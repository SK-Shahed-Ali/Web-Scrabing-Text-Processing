                        Combsí ex testifies he forced her into drug-fuelled sex partiesSean ""Diddy"" Combs former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, the star prosecution witness at his sex trafficking trial, testified on Tuesday that the rapper and hip-hop mogul forced her into repeated drug-fuelled sex parties he organised.Ventura, a rhythm and blues singer known as Cassie, said she took part in Combs‚Äô parties, known as ""Freak Offs"", for about a decade -- at first to please him and later because he blackmailed her with videos of the encounters.‚ÄúThe 'Freak Offs' became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again,"" Ventura, 38, told jurors in Manhattan federal court.She said performances could last one and a half to four days, with Combs giving her drugs to keep her awake and micromanaging her appearance.‚ÄúIf I wasn't doing my nails, I was getting a tan,‚Äù Ventura said. ‚ÄúAfter a while that wears down on you, on your confidence and self-worth.‚ÄùOne casualty was her music career, with a 10-album contract signed in 2006 with Combs‚Äô Bad Boy Records label yielding only one album, Ventura testified.Jurors were also shown a widely circulated 2016 surveillance video from the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, where Combs, wearing only a towel, threw Ventura to the ground, kicked her, and dragged her away.Ventura said the incident occurred after Combs had given her a black eye during a ""Freak Off"".‚ÄúAll I could think about was getting out of there safely,‚Äù Ventura said.Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.If convicted on all counts, he faces a minimum 15 years in prison and could face life behind bars.Combs‚Äô lawyers have said prosecutors are attempting to improperly criminalise his ""swingers"" lifestyle, where he and his girlfriends invited men to join them for sex.‚ÄúThis case is about voluntary choices made by capable adults in consensual relationships,‚Äù defence lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors on Monday.The trial began on Monday and could last two months. Combs is being housed in a Brooklyn jail when not in court.‚ÄòCONTROL WAS EVERYTHING‚ÄôWearing a brown dress and later adding a camel-coloured coat, Ventura said she began dating Combs in her early 20s, in what she thought was her ‚Äúfirst real adult relationship‚Äù.Ventura said she loved Combs at the time and wanted to make him happy.But she said Combs changed over time, frequently beating her and leaving her with black eyes and bruises all over her body.‚ÄúHe would bash my head, knock me over, drag me, kick me, stomp me in the head if I was down,‚Äù Ventura said.The grey-haired Combs, clad in a grey sweater, often crossed his arms as Ventura testified.Ventura fought back tears as she described ""Freak Offs"" in graphic detail.She said she was 22 during her first ""Freak Off"", and the only parts she enjoyed were when she and Combs were alone.But they often weren‚Äôt, Ventura testified, with Combs paying male escorts, including one nicknamed ""The Punisher"", $1,500 to $6,000 to take part.Ventura said she didn‚Äôt want to participate when others were involved but was afraid of making Combs angry.‚ÄúHis eyes were black,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe version that I fell in love with was no longer there.‚ÄùVentura also said Combs controlled much of her life and career.‚ÄúControl was everything, from the way that I looked to what I was working on that day, who I was speaking to,‚Äù she said.Ventura will resume testifying on Wednesday.Combs has apologised for his conduct in the video.His lead lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, has said the video depicted the aftermath of a dispute over infidelity.Agnifilo said at a hearing last Friday that Ventura had a history of domestic violence, signalling he may use it during cross-examination to undermine her credibility.Ventura filed a civil lawsuit in November 2023 accusing Combs of rape and serial sexual abuse. They settled after one day.Jurors may hear testimony from two or three of Combs‚Äô other female accusers, and former employees whom prosecutors say helped arrange and cover up Combs‚Äô criminal conduct.Ventura married personal trainer Alex Fine in September 2019. They have two daughters, and Ventura is pregnant.

" Critical Mahmood, EU collaborate for greener, sustainable future in Bangladesh ","
                        
                        
                        The European Union (EU) and Bangladeshi artist Critical Mahmood have launched the i've Got the Power campaign to celebrate a partnership between Bangladesh and the EU for a greener, sustainable future for all.The campaign focuses on the transformative impact of EU-supported initiatives in Bangladesh that provide renewable solutions for individuals and local communities, a media statement said on Friday.Mahmoods track, I've Got the Power, is the inspirational anthem of the campaign, highlighting the potential of clean energy to improve lives and encouraging them to adapt, it said.

" Swiss Eurovision stirs familiar controversy over Israeli entry, LGBTQ+ flags ","
                        
                        
                        Switzerland will host the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time since 1989 next week, amid familiar political criticism over LGBTQ+ rights and the participation of Israel.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) hopes its theme of ""United by Music"" will help keep the focus in Basel on the performers and their songs at the world's biggest entertainment show by viewership.

But controversy is again swirling around what critics see as the contest's growing politicisation and ideological agenda.

One row is over the inclusion of Israel, to be represented by Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack that killed 1,200 people.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, prompting officials in Spain, Slovenia, and Iceland to question whether Israel should be allowed to take part.

Palestinian organisations and human rights groups in Switzerland have also opposed Israel's participation, accusing the EBU of double standards.

""Russia was excluded from Eurovision after its invasion of Ukraine but Israel is still allowed despite committing genocide in Gaza,"" said Geri Mueller, president of the Association Swiss Palestine. Israel has repeatedly rejected such accusations.

The EBU said Israel was allowed to compete because the country was represented by KAN, its public services broadcaster, and not its government.

KAN did not respond to a request for comment.

Eurovision director Martin Green said the contest could promote a connection despite political turmoil and be a ""momentary space of joy and escapism.""

""My hope this year is that Eurovision does what it's done for the past 69 years, which is show that music can bring us together,"" Green told Reuters.

""I know that sounds maybe a little bit twee, but that is the purpose of the contest.""

Eurovision, previously mocked for its sometime tacky songs and outlandish performers, has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years, partly due to the strong support of gay fans.

It is the world's biggest entertainment event, attracting 170 million viewers last year, along with voters from more than 150 countries.

This year's event has also ignited debate in Switzerland, where a campaign by the conservative Federal Democratic Union (EDU) tried unsuccessfully to block public funding.

The EDU took issue with what it called the contest's promotion of a ""woke agenda,"" said Samuel Kullmann, a member of the Bern cantonal parliament.

""It has become like a freak show,"" he told Reuters, accusing Eurovision of pushing transgender and queer identity narratives at the expense of traditional values.

Nemo, a non-binary Swiss singer, won the 2024 contest with The Code, a track chronicling their journey of gender self-discovery.

Anti-Semitism was also cited by the EDU as a concern, referencing anti-Israel protests during last year's contest in Malmo, Sweden.

Security this year has been stepped up, with 1,300 police officers on duty, and specialists drafted in from the military and cyber security experts.

New flag guidelines restrict the stage and green room to one national flag, effectively banning the rainbow Pride flag for artists, although LGBTQ+ and regional flags will be permitted in public sections for performers and fans.

After reports that several ticketholders had non-binary pride flags confiscated last year, EBU director Green said the restriction was designed to create clarity and balance

""Eurovision needs no flag to demonstrate its alliance and celebration of the LGBTQ+ community,"" he said. ""You only have to see the show, see the people that are taking part, hear what they're singing about.""

Pink Cross, a Swiss gay and bisexual rights group, was nevertheless disappointed by the decision.

""Eurovision is a celebration of solidarity and tolerance and has a long history of supporting LGBTQ+ rights,"" said secretary general Roman Heggli. ""The flag ban is a slap in the face.""

 Trump's movie tariff threat alarms India's film makers ,"
                        
                        
                        India's film industry, which earns roughly 40 percent of its overseas revenue from the United States, sounded the alarm this week about higher costs after President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of 100 percent on all movies produced beyond American soil.

Film makers, producers and distributors in one of the world's largest film industries by output struggled to weigh the likely impact of such a tariff as Trump provided scant details, stirring more questions than answers.

""The real question is how the term 'foreign produced' will be defined, and until that's clear, it's hard to say anything,"" said film maker Anubhav Sinha, known for his Netflix streaming series, ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack"".

""It's not yet clear whether services like post-production will be affected.""

India's film industry employs 272,000 people, with overseas box office takings of about 20 billion rupees ($237 million) in fiscal 2024, or a tenth of total earnings, Deloitte and studio grouping the Motion Picture Association said in a report.

Key Hollywood films with India scenes are Oscar-winners such as the rags-to-riches tale ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and the Osama bin Laden manhunt thriller, ""Zero Dark Thirty"", along with rom-com ""Eat, Pray Love"", and Batman outing ""The Dark Knight Rises"".

In the absence of details on the planned levy, film producers worry it could double the cost of exporting their films to the United States, where people of Indian descent are estimated to number 5.2 million.

""The United States is one of the most important overseas markets for Indian cinema, largely due to the substantial diaspora,"" said producer Madhu Bhojwani, reponsible for hits such as ""Airlift"", on workers evacuated from Kuwait during the Gulf War.

""Any increase in ticket prices resulting from these tariffs would directly affect audience turnout, compounding the challenges posed by evolving consumer behaviour and broader industry headwinds.""

The cost-effective South Asian nation has also grown in stature as Hollywood's preferred hub for on-ground production and post-production services, especially in visual effects, since it offers a skilled talent pool.

""Almost 10 to 15 (foreign) movies are shot in India every year, and our movie industry will be impacted very badly,"" said film trade analyst Komal Nahta.

LIKELY HIT TO REVENUE

Prominent Indian actor and producer Prakash Raj called Trump's move ""tariff terrorism"".

If the tariff covers post-production services, the consequences will be bigger, added Bhojwani, the co-founder of Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures.

""We can expect a potential decline in outsourced work from US studios to Indian vendors, which could have notable implications for the Indian media services sector,"" she said.

""If revenue from the US drops, it could affect budget planning and profitability for Indian production houses,"" said Pradeep Dwivedi, chief executive of Eros International Media EROS.NS.

""Big-budget films counting on overseas revenue could be restructured or scaled back.""

The move will also hurt smaller releases in the United States.

""Even a 30 percent drop in revenue for such mid-scale movies would be a significant dent,"" said Raj Kandukuri, producer of a well-regarded film, ""Pelli Choopulu"", in India's southern language of Telugu.

""There are a sizeable number of students in the United States who watch movies, they will not spend high on ticket prices.""

The planned levy might also drive a broader shift to digital platforms.

""US distributors might be less inclined to pick up Indian titles due to the increased cost,"" Dwivedi said.

""This could result in fewer screens, smaller releases, and a shift toward digital platforms instead of theatrical. The tariff would likely accelerate a move toward direct-to-digital releases on platforms like ErosNow, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.""

 Sean 'Diddy' Combs defence lawyers face uphill battle in bid to undermine accusers ,"
                        
                        
                        Sean ""Diddy"" Combs will argue at his sex trafficking trial beginning next week that women who took part in his elaborate sex parties did so willingly, but his lawyers will face an uphill battle trying to undermine the credibility of accusers who say the hip-hop mogul forced them to participate.

Combs, a onetime billionaire known for elevating hip-hop in American culture in the 1990s and early 2000s, has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts including racketeering and sex trafficking.

Prosecutors with the Manhattan US Attorney's office say that for two decades, he used his business empire to lure women into his orbit with promises of romantic relationships or financial support, and then used violence and threats to obligate them to take part in days-long, drug-fueled sexual performances known as ""Freak Offs"" with male sex workers.

""The defense has quite the uphill battle ahead,"" said Heather Cucolo, a New York Law School professor. ""There was a clear power dynamic, and that power dynamic is going to be a main focus and a main issue here.""

Lawyers for Combs, 55, have said prosecutors are improperly trying to criminalise a consensual ""swingers"" lifestyle in which he and his longtime girlfriends sometimes brought a third person into their relationships.

Jury selection for his trial got under way on Monday, with opening statements scheduled for May 12.

To persuade the jury, his lawyers will have to undermine the accounts of at least four women expected to testify that he coerced them into taking part in unwanted sex acts. Combs' lawyers have signaled they intend to argue the women had financial incentives to falsely accuse Combs of abuse.

Other high-profile criminal defendants in sex abuse trials have deployed similar strategies in a #MeToo era that has encouraged victims to come forward. Many of these defendants, such as R&B singer R Kelly and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, have been convicted anyway.

Combs' defence says it has evidence the accusers are not being candid. Defence lawyer Teny Geragos said at an April 14 court hearing that one accuser, referred to in court papers as Victim-4, had ""cherry-picked"" material she chose to hand over to prosecutors, leaving out important context.

At a November 22, 2024, court hearing, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said another woman, referred to in the indictment as Victim-1, had her lawyer ask another one of Combs' lawyers for $30 million in exchange for not publishing a memoir. When the money did not materialize, she sued Combs in November 2023 and settled the case for an undisclosed amount, Agnifilo said, without naming the accuser.

R&B vocalist Casandra Ventura, Combs' longtime former girlfriend who performs under the stage name Cassie, accused Combs of sex trafficking in a November 16, 2023, lawsuit. The case swiftly settled and terms were not disclosed. Combs denied the allegations.

""It's our defence to these charges that this was a toxic, loving, 11-year relationship,"" Agnifilo said at the hearing last November.

SURVEILLANCE VIDEO

Combs faces a major obstacle: a hotel surveillance video prosecutors want to show the jury depicting Combs kicking and dragging a woman in a hallway. Prosecutors say the woman had been trying to leave a ""Freak Off"" at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016.

Combs' defensce could argue that the video depicted a domestic dispute unrelated to any racketeering conspiracy. Agnifilo has said the woman in the video had taken Combs' belongings and left the hotel room after discovering he had another girlfriend.

""To the extent that the government says that this is somehow evidence of sex trafficking, it's evidence of Mr Combs having more than one girlfriend and getting caught,"" Agnifilo said at a September 30, 2024, court hearing.

Neither prosecutors nor the defense have named the woman in the surveillance video. CNN last year broadcast a video that appeared to show him attacking Cassie in 2016. Combs posted an apology on social media days later.

Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a New York defense attorney who has tried sex crimes cases, said the indictment lacked details about other specific actions Combs had taken to compel women to take part in the ""Freak Offs.""

""The fact that he had a fight with his girlfriend seems like a thin reed to charge RICO,"" Margulis-Ohnuma said, referring to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

Prosecutors back up the RICO charge by alleging that employees of Combs' businesses helped him transport women to the ""Freak Offs,"" pay the sex workers and cover up the activity.

Combs' defence has asked US District Judge Arun Subramanian to let them call a forensic video expert as a witness to testify that one version of the hotel surveillance video was distorted to make Combs appear more domineering than he was.

But Combs' assertion that the woman in the video was stealing his property is a ""thin line of defense,"" said Mark Zauderer, a partner at New York law firm Dorf Nelson & Zauderer.

""Even if the alleged victim had done something wrong, it would be, in my opinion, very unlikely that a jury would find excusable the kind of violence that is shown in that video,"" Zauderer said.

 Stars shine in tailored looks at Met Ball celebration of Black style ,"

Mostly black-and-white looks populated the daffodil-accented deep-blue carpet covering the steps to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Guests arrived as assistants sheltered them under umbrellas in the heavy rain.

Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and actor Colman Domingo, co-chairs of the gala, were among the first of the stars of sports, music, film and television to appear.

Domingo wore a full-length royal blue pleated cloak falling from a gold-and-white casing around his shoulders. He removed the cloak to reveal a bejeweled, checkered black-and-white jacket and grey trousers. Hamilton chose an ivory suit with a beret.

The last to arrive was Rihanna, who sported a wide-brimmed black hat and a striped, corseted bodice that hugged her stomach. Her partner, musician A$AP Rocky, had arrived earlier and confirmed that Rihanna was pregnant with the couple's third child.

In between, former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had made her way into the event. She was not spotted on the carpet, but the Democratic Party posted a photo of her on social media in a long black-and-white gown.

Andre 3000 turned heads with one of the most over-the-top looks - a replica of a piano that he hauled on his back like a backpack.

Williams, the musician and creative director of Louis Vuitton menswear, wore black tuxedo pants paired with an ivory jacket adorned with 15,000 pearls.

The Met Gala, a fundraiser for the art museum's Costume Institute, has become known for its roster of A-list celebrities in extravagant outfits. This year's guests were told to dress according to the theme ""Tailored for You,"" a nod to the exhibit called ""Superfine: Tailoring Black Style"" at the museum's Costume Institute. The exhibit focuses on an elegant Black dandy aesthetic.



The theme was chosen before the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who launched an assault on diversity and inclusion efforts during the first weeks of his second term.

Andrew Bolton, head curator of the Costume Institute, said that even though work began on the exhibit in 2022, ""in this current political climate, it resonates very differently. Timing is everything.""

Also on the carpet, legendary Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan wore a silk black sherwani-style jacket over black trousers with several necklaces including one with a giant ""K.""

""Euphoria"" actor Sydney Sweeney shimmered in a fitted sparkling black gown with her hair slicked back in a bun. Her co-star Zendaya wore a white silk suit with a brimmed hat.

Some pops of color made a statement on the carpet.

Olympic gymnast Simone Biles stood out in a short bright blue dress with a white collar. Director Spike Lee wore a black suit with a silver crossbody bag, orange glasses and an orange New York Knicks cap. Singer Chappell Roan donned hot pink.

Among the notable accessories, Bad Bunny carried a brown and yellow bowling-style bag and Tessa Thompson had a fan with an image of the late fashion journalist Andre Leon Talley, who many cited as an inspiration for their outfits.

Other attendees included musicians Stevie Wonder and Shaboozey and actors Demi Moore, Nicole Kidman and Cynthia Erivo.

" Sean 'Diddy' Combs jurors say they have seen video of alleged beating, heard baby oil jokes ","
                        
                        
                        As jury selection got underway on Monday for Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' sex trafficking trial, prospective jurors said they had heard news about allegations against the hip-hop mogul, seen a video of him allegedly assaulting a woman, and even heard a comedian joke about the baby oil authorities say they found in his residences.

But simply having followed prior media coverage about the case was not enough for them to be excused from potentially serving on the jury for the two-month trial of Combs, 55, on charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty.

This week, US District Judge Arun Subramanian in Manhattan is questioning prospective jurors one-by-one, a process known as voir dire, in a bid to seat a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates who can be fair and impartial to both sides despite heavy media coverage of the case so far.

With Combs looking on wearing dark glasses and sporting a salt-and-pepper goatee, one juror said they had seen a video on the news that showed Combs allegedly assaulting someone in a hotel. Subramanian decided that juror, referred to as Juror No. 5, was qualified for the panel after they assured the judge they would be a ""blank slate entering this courtroom.""

A prospective juror was dismissed after writing in a screening questionnaire last week that a still image they had seen below a news headline of a woman on the floor in a hotel hallway and Combs standing near her ""could be damning evidence.""

Last year, CNN broadcast surveillance footage of what it said was a 2016 incident in which Combs attacked his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Casandra Ventura, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Combs apologised after the footage aired.

The jury will be anonymous, which is frequently the case in high-profile trials in which jurors could face threats or harassment if their identities are known. Subramanian's goal in voir dire is to choose 45 potential jurors who are qualified to serve, and lawyers for both sides will then have the opportunity to dismiss jurors without stating a reason.

Prosecutors have said the incident depicted in the hotel surveillance video was evidence of how Combs used force and threats over a two-decade period to coerce women to take part in days-long, drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers, which the mogul called ""Freak Offs.""

Prosecutors say employees of Combs' business empire helped the ""Freak Offs,"" including by booking hotel rooms, buying controlled substances and other items used during sex, and helping him cover up the activity. During raids of Combs' homes, authorities found drugs and 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant, prosecutors said.

One prospective juror said they had ""liked"" a video on social media in which a comedian joked about Combs and baby oil.

""I remember liking it because I thought it was funny,"" said the juror, who Subramanian decided was qualified after they said they would be able to put the video aside and be impartial.

Combs' lawyers say the hotel surveillance video depicted a domestic dispute over infidelity and was not evidence of sex trafficking. They are expected to argue that the sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual.

COMBS COULD FACE LIFE IN PRISON

Opening statements in Combs trial are scheduled for May 12.

Once known for elevating hip-hop in American culture and hosting lavish parties for the cultural elite in the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez, Combs is the latest powerful man in the entertainment industry to be accused of sexual misconduct since the #MeToo movement encouraged women to speak up about abuse.

His rags-to-riches life story saw the New York City native move from an upbringing by a single mother to living in mansions in Los Angeles and Miami. Since September he has been held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, about an hour by subway from the Harlem neighborhood where he was born.

If convicted on all counts, Combs faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison and could face life in prison.

 Brazil police foil bomb plot targeting packed Lady Gaga concert in Rio ,"
                        
                        
                        Brazilian police said on Sunday that they had thwarted a bomb attack planned for Lady Gaga's historic concert that drew over 2 million people to Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday.

The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro state, working in coordination with the Justice Ministry, said the plot was orchestrated by a group promoting hate speech and the radicalization of teenagers, including self-harm and violent content as a form of social belonging.

According to the Rio city hall, 2.1 million people attended the concert of the American pop icon.

""The suspects were recruiting participants, including minors, to carry out coordinated attacks using improvised explosives and Molotov cocktails,"" the police said in a statement.

The Justice Ministry said the recruiters identified themselves as members of Gaga's global fan base, known as the ""Little Monsters.""

The operation was based on a report by the ministry's Cyber Operations Lab following a tip-off from Rio state police intelligence, which uncovered digital cells encouraging violent behavior among teenagers using coded language and extremist symbolism.

A man described as the group's leader was arrested in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul for illegal possession of a firearm, while a teenager in Rio de Janeiro was detained for storing child pornography.

Authorities carried out over a dozen search and seizure warrants across the states of Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo.

" Take-Two delays 'GTA VI' to May 2026, extending wait for gaming's most anticipated title ","
                        
                        
                        Take-Two Interactive on Friday pushed the release of ""Grand Theft Auto VI"" to May 26, 2026, extending the wait for the most hotly anticipated title in video-gaming history and sending its shares tumbling 8 percent in early trading.

The title, developed by Rockstar Games, was previously slated for a fall 2025 launch. The franchise is the crown jewel in Take-Two's portfolio, accounting for a significant share of revenue and player engagement, and expectations for the upcoming title have been baked into Wall Street forecasts for months.

Fans have been waiting for the game for over a decade and analysts expect it to be an instant hit. The previous entry, ""Grand Theft Auto V"", released in 2013 and has sold over 200 million copies, making it one of the best-selling video games ever.

""We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto VI, which promises to be a groundbreaking blockbuster entertainment experience,"" Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said.

Delays have become commonplace in modern game development as studios grapple with rising production costs and growing pressure from players to deliver polished experiences at launch.

The postponement now pushes ""GTA VI"" out of Take-Two's fiscal 2026 release window and into 2027, which will likely bring down booking expectations for the next fiscal year. The company reiterated its expectations for sequential increases in net bookings for fiscal 2026 and 2027.

Investors await more details when Take-Two reports its fourth-quarter earnings on May 15.

Despite the delay, Take-Two has several titles lined up for the next fiscal year, including ""Borderlands 4"" and ""Mafia: The Old Country,"" which are also expected to be big launches.

""Given that Take-Two reiterated expectations of record level net bookings in both FY'26 and FY'27, we think this alleviates some of the potential concerns around sales cannibalization in FY'26,"" DA Davidson & Co analyst Wyatt Swanson said.

Rockstar Games unveiled the first trailer for ""GTA VI"" in Dec 2023, confirming the game's return to Vice City, a fictional take on Miami, and introducing Lucia, the franchise's first female lead. The teaser hinted at a modern-day Bonnie-and-Clyde duo and drew more than 100 million views within 24 hours.

The response to the delay was mixed on social media. Some users complained about waiting longer while others welcomed the additional polish.

The move will also impact the wider industry as ""GTA VI"" was expected to be a major catalyst for sector growth at a time when US tariffs have driven up gaming console prices and sparked a pullback in consumer spending.

" Virtual band PLAVE mixes K-pop, technology to charm fans ","
                        
                        
                        The five members of one of K-pop's trendiest groups PLAVE have appeared on TV, held concerts, and one of their songs has even secured a place in the prestigious Billboard Global 200, an international music chart.

On paper, they seem like any other K-pop sensation, except they are two-dimensional avatars with songs and content that have racked up over 470 million views on YouTube.

The band consisting of Yejun, Noah, Eunho, Bamby and Hamin, told Reuters they want to be globally recognised like K-pop sensation BTS.

""We don't often get to meet our fans so when we meet them at a concert we get very excited,"" said Bamby, who has pink hair and eyes. ""They cheer for us together... We make an all-out effort when we perform.""

Unlike many other virtual groups, PLAVE's label Vlast says the avatars are controlled by humans, using motion-capture and other technology to relay their actions and singing.

However, Vlast keeps the identity of the humans behind the avatars a secret, so they spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Since its debut in 2023, PLAVE has broken streaming records and topped music charts in South Korea with its latest album ‚ÄúCaligo Pt.1‚Äù released earlier this year, selling over one million copies in one week.

""For concerts, we connect our in-house motion capture studio directly to the actual concert venue in real-time,"" Vlast CEO Lee Sung-gu said in an email. ""This setup includes a feedback system that allows the members to see fan reactions from the concert venue as they perform.""

Despite the rise of artificial intelligence, Lee says his company plans to expand on the motion-capture technique.

""It‚Äôs our unique strength,"" he said.

There is little difference between virtual and real-life idols to Chang Ya Han, a 30-year-old Taiwanese fan who learned about PLAVE in an Instagram video.

""The love they give us, the way they drive us to become better, or how I wake up every day wanting to see them, that feeling is the same,"" she said at a crowded fan event in Seoul.

Vlast describes itself as a 'virtual entertainment' startup and said it received equity investments from K-pop labels HYBE and YG Plus early last year, as AI and the metaverse are increasingly embraced by the multi-million dollar K-pop industry.

According to Seoul-based music critic Kim Do Heon, PLAVE's success hinges on its interaction with fans.

""It's expensive to go to an idol group's concert and you need to use a paid messaging app to interact with them these days,"" Kim said.

""But the accessibility of cyber singers makes it much easier to like them.""

 Police seek remand for actor Siddiqur Rahman in attempted murder case ,"
                        
                        
                        A court has granted police seven days to quiz television actor Siddiqur Rahman in custody in a case involving the attempted murder of rickshaw driver Jabbar Ali Howlader during the July Uprising in Dhaka‚Äôs Gulshan.

Dhaka's Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Md Sanaullah issued the order after hearing the investigation officer‚Äôs appeal on Wednesday, said Gulshan police prosecution officer Sub-Inspector Moktar Hossain.

Gulshan Police Station's Sub-Inspector Abdus Salam said they sought a 10-day remand for Siddiqur, who was held in the court‚Äôs lockup before the hearing.

State lawyer Mahbubey Alam argued in favour of Siddiqur‚Äôs remand in court.

He said the accused did ‚Äúwhatever he pleased‚Äù during the mass uprising last year.

‚ÄúThe victim in the case was shot on the street. [Siddiqur] prevented [the victim] from being taken to the hospital. Besides, he spoke ill of Khaleda Zia at different times. We request a 10-day remand for him,‚Äù he said.

Lawyer Jahangir Biswas, who opposed the remand plea, said: ‚ÄúA specific charge against the accused in missing. [He is] not involved in the incident. He lives with his only son. The boy is ill. [Siddiqur] himself is unwell. We request that the remand petition be rejected and appeal for his bail.‚Äù

After hearing both sides, the judge remanded Siddiqur for questioning in police custody for seven days.

On Tuesday, a group of men detained Siddiqur near Bailey Road in the capital, physically assaulted him, and handed him over to Ramna Model Police Station. He was later transferred to Gulshan Police Station.

According to the case statement, on Jul 19, 2024, during an Anti-discrimination Movement protest, gunfire was opened on demonstrators in front of Confidence Tower in Shahjadpur. Jabbar was shot and injured in the incident.

Jabbar later filed a case with Gulshan Police Station accusing 109 people, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

Gulshan Police Station chief Mahmudur Rahman said on Tuesday that Siddiqur was implicated in two cases related to the Anti-discrimination Movement.

HOW SIDDIQUR WAS DETAINED

Around 5pm on Tuesday, a group of young men attacked Siddiqur and turned him over to the police.

A video clip circulating on social media shows attackers swoop in on the actor on a footpath, beat him up after calling him ‚Äúa friend of Awami League‚Äù and drag him away, ripping his shirt in the process.

Police personnel close by were initially seen not intervening in the incident, but at one point they stepped forward when Siddiqur was weeping.

In the evening, a Ramna police sub-inspector said some young men had dropped Siddique off at the police station.

This follows another incident on Thursday evening when Siddiqur‚Äôs home in Gulshan‚Äôs Shahjadpur was surrounded by local BNP activists.

According to a report by Swadesh Pratidin, the actor was at home at the time. Upon receiving word of the gathering outside, Siddiqur fled the scene in a car with the help of family members.

Actor-turned-MP Akbar Hossain Pathan Farooque won the Dhaka-17 seat in the 11th general election.

After his death, Siddiqur sought the Awami League nomination, but the ticket went to Mohammad Ali Arafat, who won the seat.

When Siddiqur was denied the nomination, he drew public attention by going live on Facebook and announcing a trip to Dubai ‚Äúto lift his mood‚Äù.

Ahead of the 12th general election, he collected nomination forms for both Dhaka-17 and his birthplace, Tangail-1, but was not selected by the party in either constituency.

The plaintiff, Enamul Haque, initiated the case against 283 people at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhaka in March.

On the court's order, Bhatara police began the process of registering the case on Tuesday.

Inspector (Investigation) Sujan Haque told bdnews24.com, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received documents today. The registration process is under way.""

Actors Suborna Mustafa, Rokeya Prachi, Sohana Saba, Meher Afroz Shaon, Jyotika Jyoti, Symon Sadik, and Azizul Hakim are among the accused in the case.

Meanwhile, Hasina and 406 others were accused in a case filed at a Dhaka court on Mar 20 over the death of BNP activist Mahfuz Alam Shrabon in Mirpur during the Anti-discrimination Movement. Actor Iresh Zaker has also been implicated in the case.

Cultural Affairs Advisor Mostafa Sarwar Farooki described the case against Iresh as ""disturbing"" during a discussion.

Speaking to journalists at the Secretariat on Monday, he said: ‚ÄúI am in the government now. If I was an activist, I could talk a lot. I personally know Iresh Zaker. He was also involved in the July movement. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs truly upsetting.""

Referring to the case, he said: ""Now everyone has the freedom to file a case. But some are misusing it.""

At a press conference on the same day, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Baharul Alam also spoke about the large numbers of accused in the cases becoming overwhelming for police to manage.

He said, ‚ÄúSome time ago, [officers-in-charge] at the police stations used to listen to the complaints, write them down, and take signatures.

‚ÄúBut now, since literacy rates have increased, people bring written complaints themselves. When a complainant brings in a written statement, under the law we cannot go beyond that.‚Äù

" Paint Dhaka red with a Tk 1,000 note! ","
                        
                        
                        If someone had told me thirty years ago that Dhaka is expensive, I would have laughed! 

In 1995, Dhaka was a city where one could easily be a king for a day with Tk 1,000 in their wallet. 

It‚Äôs true! 

Well, one can still have a comfortable day with that amount, but she or he will certainly not be in the lap of luxury. 

For a thousand bucks, you will be able to manage three comfortable meals at a desi restaurant with a friend, but no fancy drinks. 

Nowadays, one has to be strategic with one‚Äôs plans if one is to have a day out for only Tk 1,000. 

In fact, the best option is not to go out at all! 

With that amount, one can easily get 1 kg beef or three medium-sized chickens.

Get a few tips from an aunt, cook at home, head for the roof with a few homemade yoghurt drinks, marvel at the stars, enjoy the summer evening breeze and the night can still be quite memorable!

However, if you are climbing the walls at home and are desperate to get away, here is a guide on how to stretch that Tk 1,000 for entertainment, food, and even a touch of nature while leaving enough for a smoke or two. 

WATCH A MOVIE AT A TRADITIONAL CINEMA HALL 
Just a week after Eid-ul-Fitr, while the Cineplex was doing brisk business, a large number of cine lovers bemoaned that just one outing at a movie with a friend set them back nearly Tk 2,000. 

The price of tickets has seen a sharp rise recently. 

With a box of popcorn, two drinks, ticket prices and transport cost, quite a bit more money is needed for a relaxing few hours at the movies for two. 



So, to cut down on the price, head for a more traditional cinema hall. The Modhumita is still available, along with the Ananda and Chondo. 

And two tickets cost only Tk 300. 

Two cups of machine vended coffee, crisps, and a smoke during intermission will add another Tk 100 to the bill. 

It might not have the extravagance of the Cineplex, but it retains an inimitable feel as posters from forty to fifty years ago provide an unmatched experience of celluloid history and evolution. 

The disadvantage? No air conditioning. But the fans do work quite well.  

At Modhumita, if you are not in a rush, take time and go from one poster to another, and appreciate the keen artwork that gives a glimpse into the star-studded film landscapes of eras past.  

The thrill isn‚Äôt to be taken lightly. After all, in the decade after liberation, a major film genre was the extravagant costume drama, featuring sumptuous kingdoms, complex palace intrigue, swashbuckling heroes, mysterious sorceresses, and enchanting princesses. 

That template has all but disappeared! 

But that may be a story for another time. 





TWILIGHT AMIDST NATURE OR HISTORY 

If you want a more culinary flavour to your excursion, there are two great options for those on a tight budget. To really cut down on expenses head for the Dhaka University campus. 

The ‚ÄúVC Chottor‚Äù - the open space opposite the vice-chancellor‚Äôs residence - has been turned into a park with soft lights and sitting arrangements. 

And, to cater to all the growing students, a smorgasbord of street food is on offer!

For that essential cup of piping hot milk tea, you should try the Tong Tea shop inside the business faculty premises. 



For an even more memorable evening, you can head to Old Dhaka and spend a few hours at Beauty Boarding, the historical home now turned into a boarding house cum restaurant that serves delicious luchi and vegetables in the evening. 

Surrounded by greenery, the Old Dhaka institution is a time capsule with very few touches of modernity. 

The walls whisper rebellious sentiments of the pre-independence period and the thrumming energy of the anti-autocracy movement of the 80s. 

For Tk 200, you and your date can have a very hearty meal. 

No one will ask you to leave, so sit back and enjoy a touch of Bohemian twilight. 

Acquaintance with a renegade poet or a staunch socialist may be the icing on the cake. 

End the evening at Nazira Bazar at Kazi Alauddin Road with tea from the several stalls offering a wide variety of brews from the regular milk tea to tea with cream on top. 

For some added thrills, try a delicious sweet betel leaf filled with an assortment of spices. 

Those with more daring taste buds can go for the betel leaves that are set on fire and then placed inside the mouth. 

A flaming end to a fabulous day and all done with a Tk 1,000 note. 

Truly, with strategic planning, a whole day can be made into a unique experience. 

Instead of going to the cinema, you can always head towards Sadarghat for a boat trip, eat at a floating restaurant, and then, on the way back, stop at Wari for tandoori tea. 

So, instead of splurging money for an hour at a swanky, overpriced eatery, a little planning may give you a day to truly remember. 

With all these options, you must wonder what I would do with a Tk 1,000 to spend in Dhaka. 

Well, I would visit the Lalbagh Fort or the Narinda Christian Cemetery, eat Nehari at Arsalan in Lalbagh and then sip tea at the VC Chottor. 

I invite you to take the Tk 1,000 challenge yourself and let me know what particular Dhaka delights you uncover.

 India blocks release of Pakistani star Fawad Khan‚Äôs 'Abir Gulaal' after Kashmir attack ,"
                        
                        
                        India has banned the release of ""Abir Gulaal"", a film starring renowned Pakistani actor Fawad Khan, in the wake of the terror attack in Kashmir‚Äôs Pahalgam.
The movie would have marked Fawad's return to Bollywood after nearly a decade, Indian broadcaster NDTV reports.
Following the deadly attack in Jammu and Kashmir on Apr 22, India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting decided to halt the release of ""Abir Gulaal"", which also stars Vaani Kapoor, according to NDTV.
Anti-Fawad sentiments had already been building on social media even before the Pahalgam attack, but the outrage intensified afterward. The hashtag #BoycottFawadKhan trended widely, and calls for a ban on Pakistani artists working in India grew louder.
On Apr 23, the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE), an association of film industry workers, formally called for a boycott of the film. This is the same organisation that had previously demanded a ban on Pakistani artists, singers, and technicians in the Indian film industry after the Pulwama terror attack in 2019, which killed 35 paramilitary personnel.
Following the Pahalgam attack, FWICE renewed its directive. ""Despite the ongoing directive, we've been made aware of the recent collaboration with Pakistani actor Fawad Khan for the Hindi film, 'Abir Gulaal'. In light of the recent attack in Pahalgam, FWICE is once again compelled to issue a blanket boycott on all Pakistani artists, singers and technicians participating in any Indian film or entertainment projects. This includes performances or collaborations occurring anywhere in the world,"" the organisation said in a statement.
FWICE is an umbrella body representing 32 different groups of workers and technicians in India's film industry, with over 500,000 members.
The outrage following the Pahalgam attack also prompted India to take strong diplomatic steps, including suspending the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan.
India‚Äôs soft power sectors, particularly cricket and cinema, have historically seen collaboration between Indian and Pakistani stars. However, in the current climate, those bridges are being dismantled.
Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Vice-President Rajeev Shukla has confirmed that India will not engage in any bilateral cricket matches with Pakistan following the attack.
In the world of cinema, the impact is already visible -- ""Abir Gulaal"", and with it, Fawad's Bollywood comeback, will not reach Indian audiences.

                        A domestic worker has brought charges of ‚Äúphysical abuse‚Äù against Pori Moni, alleging that the actress was under the ‚Äúinfluence of drugs‚Äù during the crime.

On Tuesday, Pinky Akhter, the actress‚Äôs childminder, lodged the case with the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Nazmin Akhter.

Pinky had previously reported the incident to the police on Apr 4, alleging that she had been assaulted by Pori Moni, whose real name is Shamsunnahar Smriti.

The court recorded her statement and directed the Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) to investigate the matter and submit a report by May 8.

Pori Moni‚Äôs flatmate Sourav, 28, identified by a single name, has also been named as an accused in the case.

Pinky‚Äôs lawyer Nasidus Zaman Nishan confirmed the filing of the case.

Pinky is the daughter of Mozammel, from Fadulia village in MougatiUnion, located in Netrokona Sadar Upazila.

On Apr 4, she went to Vatara Police Station and accused Pori Moni of physically assaulting her after a child in her care had ‚Äútaken a fall‚Äù.
Vatara Police chief Mazharul Islam had stated at the time that the complaint would be looked into.

That same night, Pori Moni appeared in a Facebook Live stream, describing the allegation of assaulting her domestic worker as a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù. She said she had ‚Äúevidence‚Äù in her favour and intended to respond to the allegations through legal means.

Following media coverage of the incident, an ‚Äúangry‚Äù Pori Moni urged journalists to refrain from engaging in a ‚Äúmedia trial‚Äù.

In the case filed on Tuesday, Pinky said she began working at Pori Moni‚Äôs residence as a housemaid in March 2024 through an agency called Kader Agency. Though she was hired to care for one child, she was made responsible for two, along with cooking during the day and night.

According to the complaint, on Apr 2 at around 1pm, Pori Moni went to her makeup room and allegedly took drugs. She then entered the children‚Äôs room and began verbally abusing Pinky using obscene language.

When Pinky asked why she was being abused, Pori Moni replied, ‚ÄúWhy are you preparing milk for my child? They are supposed to eat solid food now.‚Äù

Pinky responded that she had prepared the milk in line with the child's ‚Äúfeeding routine‚Äù.

According to Pinky, Pori Moni then became enraged and slapped her repeatedly on the head, face, and eyes until she lost consciousness.

The complaint also claims that Sourav was present during the incident and encouraged Pori Moni to continue the assault.

It further states that Pinky called the emergency services at 999 and was safely taken from the scene with police assistance. She later received treatment at Kurmitola General Hospital.

Following the incident, Pinky filed a general diary with Vatara Police Station on Apr 4.

However, as no progress was made, she proceeded to file the case in court, according to the statement in the complaint.

 Shakib Khan's 'Borbad' on track for box office success in Italy ,"
                        
                        
                        Bangladeshi action thriller ""Borbad"" is making waves in Italy since its Eid-ul-Fitr release. Among the six films released during the holiday, ""Borbad"" has not only resonated with moviegoers back home but has also struck a chord with expatriate audiences abroad.
Starring superstar Bangladeshi actor Shakib Khan opposite Idhika Paul from Kolkata, the film was screened on Sunday night at the Broadway Cinema Hall in Rome.
The screening, organised by AP Entertainment and managed by Amir Hossain, saw a strong turnout from the Bangladeshi community.
Due to the overwhelming response and a packed theatre on opening night, a second screening was held the following evening at the same venue. Both shows played to full houses.
‚ÄúThe idea behind these regular screenings is to ensure that expatriates are not deprived of Bangladeshi cinema. We're seeing a much stronger response than before. If this continues, we hope to bring even more films in the future,‚Äù said Amir.
Praising the film's quality, audience member MK Rahman Liton said: ‚ÄúBangladeshi films have come a long way. Now it's something you can enjoy with your whole family at the theatre. The success of 'Borbad' proves that if a film is good, people will turn up.‚Äù
Following its successful run in Rome, ""Borbad"" is set to screen at the IMG Cinema Hall on Tuesday and again on May 4.
All tickets for the first screening sold out within 24 hours of the announcement and a second show had to be arranged due to popular demand, according to the organisers.
Discussions are also underway to release ""Borbad"" in Milan, another Italian city with a large Bangladeshi community.

""Oh my God, it's so pertinent today. But think about it. If it had been ready a year ago, it probably would have been pertinent again,"" said Luna, who plays the show's lead Cassian Andor, in an interview.

The series is about a community taking control and having a responsibility to be active citizens, Luna observed. ""It's always a beautiful reminder.""

The second and final season of the acclaimed ""Star Wars"" television series will begin streaming on Disney Plus on Tuesday.

This season follows the adventures of rebel agent Cassian Andor as numerous characters come together to create the Rebel Alliance, a staple within the ""Star Wars"" movies.

The first season of ""Andor,"" created and written by Tony Gilroy, was nominated for best drama series at the Primetime Emmy Awards.

""The writing of Tony Gilroy, it's always like proving you wrong. When you think, 'OK, it's going to go there and he's going to solve it this way,' he comes up with an idea that just makes you rethink everything and see it from a perspective you didn't know it was even possible,"" Luna said.

One unpredictable element is the romantic yet toxic relationship between two Imperial officers, Dedra, played by Denise Gough and Syril, portrayed by Kyle Soller.

After a clip was released online to promote the new season, many fans began ""shipping,"" or rooting for the two characters to become a romantic couple.

Gough admitted that until listening to Ben Mendelsohn, the Australian actor who plays antagonist Orson Krennic, she was in the dark about the meaning of ""shipping.""

""Ben Mendelsohn was like, 'It's like the Love Boat. You're on the Love Boat,"" she said. ""So that's Ben Mendelsohn's idea of shipping.""

Season Two marks the end of Luna's journey as Andor and as executive producer for the series.

""I'm going to need therapy to answer it,"" Luna said when asked how he will say goodbye to his role.

                        The West has stopped making movies with bleak endings some time ago. 

In short, protagonists do not die or end up losing the love interest and the audience do not leave the theatre with a grim face or moist eyes. 

This is because the word ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù has evolved quite a lot to solely mean relief, elation and joviality.

One goes to the cinema or cuddles up with a book not to end up feeling desolate, but to be revived. 

That is perhaps the reason why there has been a surge of Hollywood super hero films in recent times. 

A total escape from the drudgery of reality and getting lost in fantasy. 


Evil is pulverised, and the decent have reason to feel optimistic because, out there in this mean world, someone with special powers is ready to come to their aid.

Add in a few romantic lines, mind-blowing action and there you have it ‚Äì a recipe for a runaway success!

However, in Bangladesh, the word entertainment is still laced with sorrow, meaning, we get loads of movies or books where the protagonist dies or the lovers are separated, creating an atmosphere of doom and despondence. 

In written fiction, shattering readers‚Äô hearts with a tragedy is still a major motivation for writers.  

Somehow, we cannot get ‚Äútragedy‚Äù out of our system! 

If Shakespeare was around, he would be amazed to see the Romeo and Juliet impact surviving with such a vengeance among Bangladeshis. 

Notice, I did not say South Asia because other countries have moved on from the tear-jerking format. 

This Eid, of the top three movies, two saw the main characters bite the dust, although there was no need to plunge the audience into misery. 

‚ÄúHey, relax, it‚Äôs just a movie,‚Äù one of my friends told me and I realised that in half an hour we would be forgetting it. 

But then, while sipping the post movie tea, this obsession with death, tragedy and separation in fiction kept nagging me. 


DESOLATION SYNDROME WOVEN INTO THE SOCIAL CREED


The desire to end entertainment with death or separation stems from the belief that sad endings make a lasting mark while happy ones do not. 

Someone once told me, if Juliet had not taken the death-feigning potion and Romeo had not killed himself believing that his love had died, no one would have remembered the play. 

Really? 

Actually, after reading the play, I thought: ‚Äúimpetuous fools! This could have been planned better!‚Äù

If memory serves me correctly, in the mid 80s, the immensely popular BTV drama, Eishob Dinratri brought the issue of the tragic ending to the fore because Tuni, a child character, was heading to her death at the end of the series. 

The series began at a time when the middle-class struggle all across the country had a homogeneous feel since the majority of families had to face the same socio-economic hurdles. 

In the decade after liberation, life in Bangladesh was all about overcoming impediments and making the best with what was available. 

While the choices were limited, the success of being content with whatever we had was actually impressive. 

Anyway, the audience of Eishob Dinratri, anticipating the ominous ending, demanded Tuni be saved by some medical intervention or miracle. 

The writer, the renowned Humayun Ahmed, reportedly did not listen to any suggestion.

The grim reaper was not diverted!

Entertainment ended with death and stifled tears.

The same happened in another early 90s BTV series, Kothao Keu Nei, where the character, Baker Bhai, a charming rogue, is sentenced to death for a murder in which he was falsely implicated. 

Over the course of the television series, Baker Bhai, won millions of hearts with his gangster like dialogue and appearance but a solid ethical moral stand. 

Naturally, when it became clear that he would be walking the gallows, protests erupted. 

If the objection to the death in Eishob Dinratri was limited to civil comments then this time, there was a nationwide backlash with people bringing out rallies demanding Baker Bhai be saved in the last episode by a presidential pardon. 

Nope, the writer was adamant to kill him, and so, there was another tragic ending with the female protagonist waiting like a living dead at the jail gate to receive the lifeless body.

The nation wept, we avoided seeing the last bit and as far as I remember, the writer reportedly avoided public appearances for some time.  

The episodes of Kothao Keu Nei can be found on You Tube but as far as I know, most viewers never watch the last one. 

Pointless tragedy, I should say!

In reality, unless someone‚Äôs role is definitively proved in a murder, the verdict of death is avoided.

Even if a death sentence is given, for a large number of cases, the original sentence is eventually commuted to life imprisonment. 

Naturally, for a fictional work, the ending has to be dramatic or something that gives a jolt, triggering a feeling of despair plus a prolonged period of speculation, marked by a whole lot of ‚Äúifs‚Äù and ‚Äúcould haves‚Äù. 

The tendency to revel in desolation became a driving force for the band music revolution of the 80s when hit songs of most bands dealt with the pining of the jilted lover. 

ENOUGH TEARS, LET‚ÄôS LAUGH A BIT!
Do readers and movie-goers want a grim ending? I do not think so! 

The time when sadness was a pleasurable past time is gone.

By the way, film makers, writers can always choose the ‚Äúalternative ending‚Äù option if they do not want to compromise on the original plot. 

If people opt for the ending with a positive note over the ending with death and separation then the message will be very clear. 

There is a famous Kolkata short film made twice by Sandwip Ray, called Bateshwarer Abodan, where a writer, determined to kill off a main character in a popular story being serialised in a magazine, is faced with a series of puzzling incidents. 

Watch it and you will want to watch it several times. 

The message in the film is something I leave for you to find out. 

To be honest, life itself, despite a plethora of creature comforts and an increased income, still has too many low moments. 

Hence, entertainment should be just that ‚Äì a few hours of unvarnished, sometimes unrealistic pleasure.

In the end, people should come out feeling refreshed, reinvigorated and with a smile. 

If Shakespeare re-wrote Romeo and Juliet in 2025 against a Bangladeshi setting, then he would have arranged for a WhatsApp strategy between the lovers. 

How is this for an ending: Juliet wakes up, finding Romeo by her side and they make a run for it in a car belonging to a mutual friend. 

And the last scene can be a sizzling dance scene with a modern rendition of Tumi jekhane Ami Shekhane!

Tragedy, take a hike!

 Beyond the Eid boom: Can Bangladesh‚Äôs film industry break free from its Eid dependency? ,"
                        
                        
                        Cinema hall owners are celebrating a successful Eid-ul-Fitr, buoyed by strong ticket sales following the release of six well-timed films. This year broke away from the chaotic trend of overcrowded Eid releases, and the results are showing.

The impact was felt beyond the box office‚Äîoutside cinema halls, long queues formed and many eager filmgoers left disappointed, unable to secure the coveted tickets to their preferred shows.

However, producers remain mostly disappointed with their earnings from screening films throughout the rest of the year. 

As there is no proper 'box office' system in the country, they are also unable to get an accurate calculation of real income.

In order to sustain commercial success, they are demanding the development of the film industry, a reliable distribution system, and long-term infrastructure improvements.

On the other hand, despite doing ""good business"" during Eid, cinema hall owners have pointed out that such ""seasonal"" success cannot compensate for the losses incurred throughout the year.

Both cinema hall owners and the leadership of the exhibitors‚Äô association have stressed the importance of maintaining the momentum of the Eid business throughout the entire year.



Six films were released in theatres during Eid. 

These include ""Borbaad"" directed by Mehedi Hasan Hridoy, ""Antoratma"" by Wajed Ali Sumon, ""Jongli"" by M Rahim, ""Daagi"" directed by Shihab Shaheen, ""Jinn 3"" by Kamruzzaman Roman, and ""Chokkor"" by Sharaf Ahmed Jibon.

Borbaad and Antoratma, both starring Dhallywood superstar Shakib Khan, were among the most anticipated films of the season.

Other major releases featured popular actors including Mosharraf Karim, Afran Nisho, Siam Ahmed, Tama Mirza, Shobnom Bubly, and Nusraat Faria.

Despite the initial excitement, Antoratma was pulled from Star Cineplex on the second day of Eid, reportedly due to a ‚Äúlack of audience interest‚Äù.

Another film, Jinn 3, was removed from theatres just 12 days after its release following poor box office performance. 

The film was not screened in any other theatres across the country.

Three films have stood out in terms of commercial performance, according to theatre owners: Shakib‚Äôs Borbaad, Nisho‚Äôs Daagi, and Siam‚Äôs Jongli.

Each has managed to stay in theatres for two weeks following Eid.

Mosharraf Karim‚Äôs Chokkor, meanwhile, continues to run exclusively at Star Cineplex.



 

OWNERS DELIGHTED AS AUDIENCE NUMBERS SURGE

Renowned Modhumita Cinema Hall has finally opened its doors after four months, thanks to Shakib Khan starrer Borbaad.

Modhumita‚Äôs owner, Iftekhar Uddin Naushad, told Glitz: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going well. I think this will be the highest-grossing film. It will surpass all the sales of Toofan and Priyotoma. There‚Äôs a huge audience.‚Äù

On Eid day, six films were released at Star Cineplex. 

Since Antoratma and Jinn 3 didn‚Äôt perform well, only four films are currently being screened there, which increased audience footfall.

The number of screenings for Daagi has increased since its first week in theatres, reflecting a growing interest from audiences.

According to Mesbah Uddin, senior manager of the media and marketing department at Star Cineplex, the schedules for films with stronger audience demand were expanded by dropping Antoratma and Jinn 3.

In the second week following Eid, four movies are currently showing at Star Cineplex. 

Of these, Shakib‚Äôs Borbaad has 39 screenings, Daagi has 30, Jongli has 13, and Chokkor has 4.

Mesbah told Glitz that the demand for Borbaad remains strong, with sold-out shows and long queues.

‚ÄúThe audience is returning without getting tickets,‚Äù he said. 

‚ÄúAdvance tickets are being sold. Business is going well.‚Äù

At Lion Cinema Hall, Borbad, Jongli, and Daagi have been screening since Friday.

The owner of this theatre, Mirza Abdul Khalek, told Glitz: ‚ÄúBorbaad is doing very well. Three special shows were held on Friday night. The other two films are also going houseful.‚Äù

When asked about the number of tickets sold in the 10 days since Eid, Khalek said: ‚ÄúBy Thursday, 25,677 tickets were sold, of which around 17,000 were for Borbaad.‚Äù

‚ÄúAround 8,000 tickets were sold for the other films.‚Äù

He believes Borbaad will surpass the ticket sales of Shakib‚Äôs last Eid film, Toofan.



 

At Dhaka‚Äôs Shyamoli Cinema Hall, Borbaad initially had a good audience turnout in all shows. 

However, in the second week, attendance dropped slightly for the morning and noon shows. 

Still, compared to previous years, business is better this Eid, said the hall‚Äôs manager, Mohammad Hasan.

He mentioned that while the 12pm and 2:40pm shows see fewer viewers, the other two shows are going houseful, and advance ticket sales are ongoing.

MOVIE THEATRES KEEP SCREENS LIT PAST MIDNIGHT

Due to high audience demand, special midnight screenings of Borbaad were held at Lion Cinemas in Keraniganj and Modhuban Cineplex in Bogura.

Roknuzzaman Yunus, managing director of Modhuban, said Borbaad has been performing well from the start, selling about 16,000 tickets until last Thursday. 

Special late-night shows were arranged on audience request, with screenings at 11:45pm on Eid‚Äôs second night and again on Friday night.

Due to high demand, Modhuban also introduced a new 10am show, which quickly sold out. 

They expect houseful shows to continue until Pohela Boishakh.

FLIP SIDE OF THE COIN 

Cinema halls outside Dhaka are reporting good business during Eid, with audiences returning to theatres. 

In Jashore, the Monihar Cinema Hall is screening Borbaad, and Daagi is playing at Monihar Cineplex.

The theatre's director, Ziaul Islam, mentioned that although Borbaad hasn‚Äôt sold out all 1,200 seats, attendance is strong, and they're seeing profits.

‚ÄúDaagi is also doing well in the multiplex, with full houses in its 66-seat screen. 

He noted that a good film draws viewers, emphasising the need for more quality films.

In Khulna, Jongli is running at the Sangeeta Cinema Hall. 

Booking Agent Asaduzzaman Tutul said the movie has earned around Tk 300,000 to Tk 400,000 in 12 days, with healthy attendance across city theatres.

However, Barishal tells a different story. 

Only one cinema hall, Abhiruchi, remains from the original five.

Manager Rezaul Kabir said business is good and crowd turnout has been impressive, but he lamented the lack of year-round content. 

He urged filmmakers to produce regular quality films, noting that audience interest exists but not enough movies are released outside of Eid seasons.

Rezaul fears that without consistent releases, even Abhiruchi may shut down. 

He stressed that while Eid releases succeed, the focus should be on sustaining this success year-round. 

He also criticised the lack of attention to regional cinemas, saying all development seems Dhaka and Film Development Corporation-centred.

‚ÄúNo one even bothers to find out how the cinema hall is doing throughout the year, whether it is still there or is closing down,‚Äù said Rezaul.

‚ÄúAll the development of the film industry is centred on the FDC. One day, the producers will also have to make films and prepare halls for their release. Therefore, instead of expressing excitement that one Eid film is doing well, emphasis should be placed on making this good performance regular.‚Äù

Meanwhile, in Narayanganj, the New Metro Cinema Hall is also showing Borbaad, but after a strong start, it‚Äôs now facing a drop in attendance, especially on weekends.

Ravi Babu, an employee of the hall, said: ‚ÄúFour movies are being shown here. But it‚Äôs not a full house. The first three or four days were good. There are no viewers even on Fridays.‚Äù

AN ADVANCE TICKET IS ALL IT TAKES TO CATCH A SHOW

Even ten days after the Eid film releases, cinemas are still drawing large crowds. 

However, only those who bought tickets in advance are getting to watch the movies, with many having to return without tickets.

Mahbub Jewel, who has lived in Dhaka for 25 years, watched a movie in a cinema hall for the first time. 



 

After seeing Borbaad at the new Star Cineplex branch in Uttara, Jewel said:  ‚ÄúI liked the movie a lot. The story was good. The production was also good. The depth of the story, and the songs were entertaining.‚Äù

Fahim, who came with six friends from Moghbazar to watch Jongli, had also purchased tickets ahead of time. 

‚ÄúWe are seven friends who came together from Moghbazar. I liked the movie. Siam Ahmed did a great job. It is a very emotional movie.""

Aminul, who came from Shanir Akhra with his wife, was disappointed when he couldn't get tickets at the counter.

‚ÄúWhen I arrived at the counter, I heard that there were no tickets. Only those who have already booked can watch the movie.""

Rabbi, a young man who identified himself with a single name, said he watched Daagi and Chokkor, and found both enjoyable. 

He said, ""All the movies released this Eid are worth watching. At least three or four movies should be watched. I have already seen 'Daagi' and 'Chokkor'. I enjoyed watching both movies. The acting, story, and dialogues are all beautiful.""

TICKET PRICES

Movie ticket prices vary widely across Dhaka and other cities.

In Dhaka, Modhumita charges Tk 200‚ÄìTk 250, Lion Cinema charges Tk 300-Tk 350, and Star Cineplex tickets range from Tk 400 to Tk 1800.

Outside the capital, Monihar in Jashore charges Tk 210‚ÄìTk260, while Bogura‚Äôs Modhuban Cineplex offers tickets from Tk 100 to Tk 300, depending on the category.

PUSH GROWS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CATERS TO PRODUCERS‚Äô NEEDS

Despite strong audience turnout during Eid, producers are disappointed, stating it is difficult to raise investment due to the lack of e-ticketing, box office or proper infrastructure of cinema halls.

After being released in at least 120 theatres during Eid, Borbaad earned Tk 270 million in its first week, but producer Shahreen Akter said they‚Äôve only received around Tk 40 to 50 million due to several deductions.

""The movie is doing well. The audience has returned. But the amount we producers are actually earning is questionable,‚Äù said Shahreen.

‚ÄúAfter deducting different commissions from the price of each ticket, we get only Tk 30 to Tk 40. This includes the expenses of the hall owner, agent and other expenses. The biggest crisis is that there is no box office reporting system in the country. As a result, no one knows the actual income.""

She pointed out that even basic promotional expenses like printing posters and banners now fall entirely on the producers. 

""Here, printing posters and banners is now the responsibility of the producer. Even those who earn millions of taka do not want to bear these expenses themselves. If we budget Tk 150 million until the end of the film, the other expenses increase after the release of the film. At the end of the day, we are not getting a producer-friendly system. We are not able to know transparently how our films are selling.""

Calling on the government and film stakeholders to pay attention to this issue, the producer said: ‚ÄúA long-term, producer-friendly infrastructure should be built so that everyone can survive and make good films.‚Äù



 

When asked about the performance of Daagi, producer Shahriar told Glitz: ‚ÄúIt is very, very difficult to calculate how many people viewed our movies, or how many tickets have been sold in Bangladesh. There is no e-ticketing system here, no box office system.‚Äù

""The budget of our movie is Tk 45 million. The cinema halls in Bangladesh have a good audience capacity. But we do not get proper information because there is no e-ticketing or box office. Producers in Bangladesh are very helpless from this point of view.""

He also pointed out a critical issue - a theatre capable of selling tickets worth Tk 1.8 million often rents the movie for just Tk 400,000 to Tk 500,000 for two weeks. Even if the film does great business, the producer only gets that fixed rental amount.

He stressed the need for infrastructure reform, saying that without a central server, e-ticketing, or box office tracking, it's very hard for producers to recover their investment.

Meanwhile, Jinn 3 was recently pulled from Star Cineplex and Lion Cinema, but its producer Abdul Aziz said it performed reasonably well and the business was ‚Äúnot bad‚Äù.

Sharaf Ahmed Jibon, the producer and director of Chokkor, said the first week of Eid was chaotic, and it was hard to secure screens against big-budget films. 

However, in the second week, the movie got better shows, and he expects revenue to pick up gradually.

Jibon, whose film Chokkor marks his debut as a director and producer, admitted he is still learning the ins and outs of the film industry.

‚ÄúSince it's my first movie, and my first time producing, I may not know much. The structure of this place is different. There's a lot to learn and understand. But the box office system is necessary.""

HOW‚ÄôS THE BUSINESS?

When asked about overall Eid business, Awlad Hossain Ujjal, general secretary of the Exhibitors' Association, told Glitz that audience turnout has significantly ‚Äúincreased‚Äù.

""Audiences are watching movies with their families on Eid. This trend has been seen across the country after many years. Every theatre is doing super duper hit business,"" said Ujjal.

However, he stressed that the industry cannot rely solely on Eid releases. 

""Even if we make 30 movies a year, and if we show five or six hit movies with good stories, the situation in the halls will improve.""

Sudipta Kumar Das, an advisor to the Exhibitors' Association, echoed similar views, saying the success of Eid releases must be maintained. 

‚ÄúWe will soon hold a meeting to discuss how to maintain it, and how to take it forward. We will advise the hall owners that those who have shown the movie on Eid should show another alternative movie after it. Then all the movies on Eid will be able to do business.‚Äù

Mirza Abdul Khalek, owner of Lion Cinema Hall, expressed caution when asked if Bangladeshi cinema is entering a new golden age.

He explained that despite the strong Eid business, he had suffered heavy losses of around Tk 4.2 million since last Eid-ul-Azha, covering staff salaries and bills. 

While this Eid was profitable, it hasn‚Äôt fully offset his previous losses, he added.

He said that depending only on Eid for business is unsustainable. 

""I did business this Eid, but now I have to wait for Eid-ul-Azha. After Eid is over, I have to worry about how I will run the theatre for the next ten months.""

He described this over-reliance on Eid-centric releases as one of the ‚Äúbiggest concerns‚Äù for the future of Bangladeshi cinema.

                        Strobe lighting, hardcore bass and screaming fans wearing ""Brat"" T-shirts defined English pop singer Charli xcx's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival performance on Saturday night.

The Grammy-winner brought her signature club party energy, inviting fellow singers Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish, and Lorde to join her on stage.

Sivan and Charli xcx, who joined forces in 2024 for the Sweat Tour, reunited on stage at Coachella to perform the song ""Talk Talk.""

The Charli xcx's ""Brat"" album inspired a cultural phenomenon on TikTok and beyond last summer.

Some of the songs she performed at the festival include ""365,"" ""360"" and ""Von Dutch.""

Following Charli xcx on the main stage, punk rockers Green Day decided to address some political issues, criticising ""Make America Great"" (MAGA) supporters and spotlighting the struggles of Palestinian children, by changing the lyrics of their songs.

Singer Billie Joe Armstrong changed the lyrics in the song ""American Idiot,"" from ""I‚Äôm not a part of a redneck agenda"" to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not part of the MAGA agenda.""

Later, the ""21 Guns"" singer also changed the ""American Idiot"" lyrics ""Runnin' away from pain when you've been victimized,"" to ""Run away from pain, like the kids from Palestine. Tales from another broken home.""

For Green Day, planting political messages in their performances is nothing new, including changing the lyrics of the song ‚ÄúJesus of Suburbia"" in March during the band's concert in Australia.

Green Day took aim at US Vice President JD Vance, after he and President Donald Trump had a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the Oval Office.

Armstrong sang: ‚ÄúAm I retarded or am I just JD Vance,‚Äù instead of, ‚ÄúAm I retarded or am I just overjoyed?‚Äù

The band has also taken jabs at Trump and Elon Musk.

The group also paid homage to punk rock music throughout the decades, including their songs ""Wake Me Up When September Ends,"" and ""Know Your Enemy.""

Ending the night, rapper Travis Scott, known for his 2021 Astroworld Festival performance in Houston where a dangerous crowd surge resulted in 10 deaths, was late to his Coachella performance.

However, fans were cheering when a brass band arrived on stage, signaling the start of the ""SICKO MODE"" rapper's set.

Scott's show included massive bursts of fire and strobe, while he and his dancers were suspended in mid-air for some aerial moves.

Songs the rapper performed include ""Skyfall"" and ""Highest in the Room,""

He was also joined by American rappers Playboi Carti and Don Toliver.

 Brazilian DJ Alok fears visa removal for international artists in US ,"
                        
                        
                        Brazilian DJ Alok brought a beaming blend of electronic dance beats to the stage on Saturday at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival despite the growing fears of international artists about the future of performing in America.

""For me as a Brazilian, it's always been hard to get a visa. So, for us, it didn't change much,"" Alok told Reuters during an interview backstage at Coachella, held in Southern California.

""But, of course, for Europe and others, they changed the rules, right?"" he added.

He heard about other Coachella performances being cancelled in 2025 due to visa issues and feels fortunate that he made it to the festival when other international artists could not.

In the first week of April, British singer FKA Twiggs, who was scheduled to perfom at Coachella, cancelled her performance.

She said that she was bowing out due to ""visa issues"" on the social media platform Instagram.

She also cancelled her entire North American tour.

With the Trump administration rapidly cancelling the international student visas of pro-Palestinian activists as well as revoking the legal status for 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, international music artists have also found that they are not immune.

In March, British punk rock band member of UK Subs, Alvin Gibbs, shared on the social media platform Facebook that they were allegedly denied entry into the United States while traveling to their performance at LA Punk Invasion 2025.

Despite evolving visa policies looming, the music producer Alok did not fret about the future during his set. He moved his music to the next level.

While Alok traditionally uses LED projections to create rows of artificial background dancers for his music sets, for his Coachella set, he evolved the performance with live performers dancing to his beats.

""It was very challenging. I'm very used to doing a lot of crazy stuff in the shows, very integrating with new technology, but this one for sure was the most difficult,"" Alok said.

We're dealing with human technology and the synchronizing. But it's also something beautiful because once we are connected in the same synergy, same purpose, we can do stuff that is extraordinary,"" he added, noting a desire to keep performance human instead leaning too much on artificial intelligence.

""Art is made by soul,"" the singer said, later adding his appreciation for his guest performer, American singer Ava Max.

Alok is best known for his 2016 single ""Hear Me Now"" and for his 2024 album, ""The Future is Ancestral,"" which features nine dance tracks mixed with indigenous songs, some of which have been sung for centuries by Brazilian tribes.

 Lady Gaga brings 'Mayhem' to the masses at Coachella ,"
                        
                        
                        American singer Lady Gaga returned to a massive audience for the first time in eight years to headline the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Friday night, dancing with model skeletons, fighting a dancer dressed as a monster and serving up a surprise encore.

""Welcome to my house of mayhem,"" the ""Poker Face"" singer said from the stage.

 Bella Ramsey teases action-packed season 2 of 'The Last of Us' ,"
                        
                        
                        Makers of the post-apocalyptic TV series ""The Last of Us"" say fans are in for extra action and scarier zombies when the show returns for a much-awaited second season, two years after the first season finale aired.
The series is based on the video game franchise of the same name and follows survivors Joel Miller, played by Pedro Pascal, and his young prot√©g√© Ellie (Bella Ramsey), who fight mutated creatures and other people.
The show's second season takes place five years after the events of the first season, and sees Joel and Ellie, who is now 19, settled in Jackson, Wyoming, and at odds with each other.
""There's a lot more action in this season, or more like physical fighting. It was more intense, more emotionally complex,"" Ramsey said premi√®ring the new season in London on Thursday.
Craig Mazin, who co-created the series with Neil Druckmann, said the seven-episode second season stays loyal to its source material and the style they established previously.
""Neil and I just said, we're going to adapt following the same method as season one. So, let's not change anything, which I think sometimes people change things, but if it's working, you sort of keep your process,"" Mazin said.
""But we did learn a lot about mounting action and about portraying the infected and making them even more convincing, more grounded and more scary. So, people that really like the infected and maybe thought, 'oh, I wish we had seen some more', there will be more because the story demands it,"" he added.
The second season also introduces audiences to new characters. It stars Isabela Merced in the role of Dina, Ellie's best friend, and Beef actor Young Mazino as Dina's ex, Jesse, a ""pillar of his community"".
The series has already been confirmed to return for a third season.
""Season 3 is very exciting. There's a little hint in the second season, I reckon, as to where the third season is going to go, so watch out for that,"" said Ramsey.
""The Last of Us"" season 2 debuts on HBO and Max on Apr 13 and Sky and NOW on Apr 14.

                        Having spent nearly three decades in the Bangladeshi music scene, rock band Shironamhin is gearing up for its first tour of Canada.
The band, known for their distinct folk sound with a mix of progressive rock weaved into it, is scheduled to perform live this September, kicking off their trip to Canada with a concert in Toronto, organised by Mixtape.
Describing 2025 as a year of ""variation"" for the band, frontman Ziaur Rahman shared that Shironamhin has plans for several international tours this year.
Composer Kazi Ahmad Shafin reflected on their recent tour of Europe, saying: ""Last year, we travelled across several European countries, their culture and landscapes left us truly inspired. We‚Äôre looking forward to enjoying this year‚Äôs tours just as much.""
Vocalist Sheikh Ishtiaque added, ""These tours give us experiences and emotions that are essential for creative growth.""
Earlier, on Feb 15, Shironamhin released their latest track ‚ÄúPriyotoma‚Äù from their upcoming album ‚ÄúBatighor‚Äù.
The band has four more tracks ready for release, each paired with music videos shot across multiple locations in Thailand and India.
Additionally, fans can look forward to a sequel to their popular track ‚ÄúEi Obelay‚Äù, which the band plans to release once sponsorship is secured.

 Universal to open first European theme park near London ,"
                        
                        
                        US media giant Comcast Corp has chosen an area north of London for its first Universal theme park and resort in Europe, pledging to build rides and attractions based on its movie franchises that it hopes will rival Disneyland Paris.

The group, home to the Jurassic Park and Harry Potter movie franchises, said the park in Bedford would create 20,000 jobs during construction and a further 8,000 across the hospitality and creative industries when it opens in 2031.

It is expected to attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year, a number currently only exceeded in Europe by Disneyland to the east of the French capital.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and finance minister Rachel Reeves joined Comcast bosses to announce the theme park on Wednesday.

""This will drive growth here and across the country,"" Starmer said.

The Labour government has pledged to boost investment in infrastructure since it was elected last year, and Britain's economy needs fresh momentum after the highest tax-raising budget since 1993 in October dented business confidence.

The government has pledged to speed up planning decisions and the announcement comes after it approved the expansion of Luton Airport, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometres) from the Universal site, boosting the area's international connectivity.

""This (theme park) is our 'Plan for Change' in action, bringing investment, bringing opportunity, growth, jobs and, of course, joy to Britain,"" Starmer said.

Universal has five resorts and parks, in the US states of California and Florida as well as in Singapore, Japan and China, offering rides and attractions based on its movie franchises.

Plans for the new site include a theme park, featuring several themed lands, a 500-room hotel and a retail, dining and entertainment complex.

Comcast President Mike Cavanagh showed Starmer the plan in London on Tuesday, saying he ""could not be more excited"" to create a Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom.

Comcast bought a 500-acre former brickworks in Bedfordshire, about 55 miles north of London, in 2023 and had been in talks with the government since last year. It already owns Sky, which is Europe's biggest pay-TV business.

The theme park and resort are subject to planning permission, the government said.

 Viola Davis makes younger self proud as US president in 'G20' ,"
                        
                        
                        For Viola Davis, seeing her first images of a ""badass Black woman on television"" when she was growing up became an inspiration for her role as the US president in the thriller film ""G20.""
The 1974 American crime drama series ""Get Christie Love!"" starring Teresa Graves as an undercover detective immediately captivated Davis.
""Whenever she would arrest someone, she was like 'You're under arrest, baby!,' and I was like 'Oh my God! Oh my goodness!' and she would throw men off balconies,"" Davis told Reuters.
""When you see it, you can believe it. When you see it, you can see yourself in it and there's something about being seen that forces you to see yourself,"" she added.
""G20,"" which arrives on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, is directed by Mexican director Patricia Riggen and follows Davis' character US President Danielle Sutton, who protects her family and other world leaders when a G20 summit in Cape Town, South Africa is infiltrated by terrorists.
The movie also stars Anthony Anderson as Danielle's husband and first gentleman Derek Sutton, ""black-ish"" actor Marsai Martin as their daughter Serena Sutton, and Christopher Farrar as their son Demetrius Sutton.
Davis specifically requested Anderson to play her movie husband because of their close bond.
""We've always had a great relationship, just in the same network, traveling in the same circles, having the same friends,"" Anderson said.
However, both Davis and Anderson admitted that their biggest bonding experiences came from collecting free items together at gifting suites.
""I didn't want to mention that. We like the free stuff,‚Äù said Davis, triggering a fit of laughter from both of the actors.
Another thing about the movie that amused Davis was thinking about how her younger self would be ecstatic to see her playing the role of Danielle.
""That 6-year-old Viola has been serving me. My job is to make her squeal. My job is to make her really excited about who she's going to become,"" Viola said.
Davis is known for her EGOT status, which stands for a winner of the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards, and is one of the highest honors for a performer in Hollywood.

 'Handmaid's Tale' star Elisabeth Moss not ready for final season farewell ,"
                        
                        
                        As a producer, director and the lead actor for the Emmy-winning Hulu series ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale,‚Äù Elisabeth Moss isn‚Äôt ready to say goodbye to the dystopian drama series after a six-season long run.

‚ÄúThere's been a very few periods of my life in the last nine years that I have not been working on this show,‚Äù Moss said.

‚ÄúIt hasn't hit me at all yet that I'm not playing her (June Osborne) anymore,‚Äù she added.

The series, created by Bruce Miller and based on the 1985 novel of the same name by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, will debut its sixth and final season on Hulu on Tuesday.

The show follows the totalitarian religious extremist government of Gilead that is driven by power-hungry men who brutally subjugate women in the aftermath of collapsing fertility rates and war.

Some women, called handmaids, are treated as breeders who must bear children for superior infertile families.

Moss plays a woman named June Osborne, who is forced to become a handmaid along with her friend Moira Strand, played by Samira Wiley.

Other cast members include Ann Dowd as Aunt Lydia Clements, a woman in charge of overseeing the handmaids and Bradley Whitford as Commander Joseph Lawrence, a repentant leader in Gilead.

Whitford and Moss find it striking how much the show has become a symbol for the real-life global women‚Äôs rights movement.

‚ÄúThere's a message about resistance, that is basically what I would say, the theme of this final season is,‚Äù Whitford said.

‚ÄúI think we all feel very lucky to be part of something that's getting that message out,‚Äù actor, who also starred in ‚ÄúThe West Wing,‚Äù added.

Echoing this, Moss reflected on how the final season makes an effort to create a bigger impact and highlights the importance of revolution.

‚ÄúI feel like we feel so proud and so honored that people have taken this show as a symbol of resistance and using that (handmaid) costume as a symbol of resistance and being able to use this show to encourage themselves to fight for what they believe in,‚Äù Moss said.

For her, it was vital to push further than ever before for the show‚Äôs finale.

""It was the biggest season we've ever done, more locations, more cast, more story, more sets, just everything we did was bigger,‚Äù the actor said.

 ‚ÄòCan't tell you how nervous I am‚Äô: Hrithik gets candid about 'Krrish 4' ,"
                        
                        
                        After spending 25 years following directors‚Äô instructions on screen, Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan is now set to call the shots behind the camera.
The actor is stepping into the role of director for the fourth instalment of the popular superhero-action franchise ""Krrish"". While excited about the new chapter, Hrithik admits to feeling a bit ""nervous‚Äù and hopes to begin this journey with the encouragement and good wishes of his fans, Hindustan Times reports.
At a recent event in Atlanta, Hrithik said: ""I can‚Äôt tell you how nervous I am. I need all the encouragement I possibly can get."" When fans responded with applause and cheers, Hrithik added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take all the love back with me.‚Äù
Last week, it was officially announced that Hrithik will be taking over the directorial reins from his father, veteran filmmaker Rakesh Roshan. The film will be co-produced by Rakesh Roshan and Aditya Chopra‚Äôs Yash Raj Films.
Hrithik has played the lead in all three previous Krrish films, and now, for the first time, he will also be directing one. Filming is expected to begin early next year.
Rumours of ""Krrish 4"" have been circulating for years, but the project faced several delays. One of the biggest roadblocks was the massive 7 billion rupee budget proposed by Rakesh Roshan, which initially made producers hesitant to commit. However, the situation changed when Aditya Chopra agreed to back the film, clearing the path forward.
The Krrish franchise began in 2003 with the hit ""Koi‚Ä¶ Mil Gaya"", followed by ""Krrish"" in 2006 and ""Krrish 3"" in 2013. All three films were box office successes.
In a statement announcing Hrithik's directorial debut last week, his father Rakesh had said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm passing the baton of the director of 'Krrish 4' to my son, Hrithik Roshan, who has lived, breathed and dreamt about this franchise since its inception with me! Hrithik has a clear and a very ambitious vision of taking Krrish‚Äôs journey forward with the audience for the next decades. I couldn‚Äôt be more proud to see him wear the director‚Äôs hat for a film that means the world to us as a family.""
Rakesh was also excited about Yash Raj Films‚Äô involvement, which he believes will take ""Krrish 4"" to a whole new level.
‚ÄúHrithik and Adi coming together as a producer-director pair with me behind them is a rare and deliciously creative combination! I‚Äôm sure they will turn 'Krrish 4' into a theatrical experience that has never been made in India. The dream is to make India proud globally with a larger than life experience like 'Krrish 4'. It was he who convinced Hrithik to sit in the director‚Äôs chair.""
Before becoming an actor, Hrithik worked as an assistant director on his father‚Äôs films, including ""Khudgarz"", ""King Uncle"", ""Karan Arjun"" and ""Koyla"".

 'Adolescence' TV drama exposes global issue of teenage violence ,"
                        
                        
                        TV drama ""Adolescence"" has shocked and captivated audiences around the world, providing what campaigners say is a rare opportunity to tackle the largely hidden world of online misogyny and violence.

Since its release on Netflix on Mar 13, more than 96 million people have watched the British four-episode series that begins with armed police raiding the home of a terrified 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a young girl, and ends with a raw illustration of the pain of his broken family.

The action in between, with each hour-long episode shot in a dizzying single take, slowly destroys the initial disbelief that a child so young could commit such a violent crime.

It depicts a toxic online culture known loosely as the manosphere in which common teenage male insecurities about attractiveness and romantic failure can warp into resentment and hatred of the opposite sex.

""There are people who will watch it and go 'but that boy couldn't do that'. The point is that boy can do it,"" said Susie McDonald, CEO of charity Tender that educates children and adults on healthy relationships

""Suddenly the possibility becomes normal, and so we begin to say, what on earth can we do to stop that from happening?""

The show is number one in the Netflix global Top 10 and heads the charts in almost every country - from Brazil to Bahrain - for which the streaming platform provides data.

""Although on the surface it feels like it's a very British production ... actually, the themes that it's dealing with: what our children are doing online, what they're listening to ... I think that's as important in America, as it is India, as it is Australia,"" film critic Kaleem Aftab told Reuters.

Portuguese police produced a guide for parents to explain the hidden meaning of emojis used by young people - a plot component in the show. The Sydney Morning Herald produced a guide on how to talk to children more effectively than the parents in the programme.

British police urged parents to look for signs their child may be being radicalised online, using data showing 60 percent of referrals to its terrorism prevention system came from children aged 17 or under to highlight the scale of the wider problem.

HIT HOME HARD IN DOWNING STREET

""Adolescence"" reached the home of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who watched it with his teenage son and daughter.

""It hit home hard,"" Starmer said in a statement, backing a scheme to make the show available to schools across the country and encouraging a national conversation on the issues it raises.

""This isn't a challenge politicians can simply legislate for. Believe me, if I could pull a lever to solve it, I would.""

Matt Pinkett, an author on masculinity and a teacher, described how the show had left him fizzing with lesson ideas, but said it needed to be used carefully to avoid further marginalising boys already at risk of radicalisation.

The show has created a moment that campaigners, police and educators have been waiting for: a general public prepared to accept the uncomfortable truth that they do not know what their children are doing online, and that they all need help.

""This is the start of something. What we need to do as an education profession is make sure that we take advantage of that,"" said Pepe Di'Iasio, General Secretary of Britain's Association of School and College Leaders.

McDonald said Tender was working with Netflix to produce materials teachers can use in schools, using script excerpts and clips of scenes to spark wider discussion.

                        Since the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel, which triggered a devastating military response, Gaza has endured sustained bombardment.
More than a year later, the toll continues to mount as corpses line the streets.
The cries of the wounded echo through the air as the skeletal remains of buildings mark a deepening humanitarian crisis.
In cities around the globe, anti-war protests have persisted for months, with demonstrators calling for an end to the bloodshed.
While a ceasefire offered a brief respite, it has since unravelled, plunging the besieged territory into fresh turmoil.
Bangladeshi celebrities have taken to social media to protest against the genocide.
‚ÄúGaza is not just a geographical name; it is a symbol of the oppressed people today,‚Äù wrote superstar Shakib Khan in a Facebook post.
The Dhallywood actor declared his support for the people of Gaza, expressing his resolve to stand by them.
Actor Siam Ahmed said: ‚ÄúBy the time I am writing this post, has the existence of Gaza been erased?‚Äù
‚ÄúCan any of us avoid responsibility for these ruins of Palestine? I could never stop crying for Palestine.‚Äù
Siam also drew a comparison between his latest film and the Gaza tragedy, writing: ‚ÄúWhen the story of ‚ÄòJongli‚Äô was being written, I kept imagining Palestinian children instead of birds. Can't we gift a beautiful world to children?‚Äù
Actress Jaya Ahsan expressed solidarity with a global campaign that called for a boycott of educational institutions and offices in protest of the violence.
Sharing a poster on Facebook, she wrote: ‚ÄúYes! Of course, solidarity against the Israeli occupation and genocide.‚Äù

Actor Shajal Noor posted an image of the destruction in Gaza, asking: ‚ÄúWhere is the humanity? Can any human being do this?‚Äù
He urged his followers to stand by Palestinians.

""Giant"" also won best new play and Lithgow's co-star Elliot Levey won best actor in a supporting role.

In the live video, Pori Moni explained: ""If you look at how I‚Äôve lived, you‚Äôll see that my entire family consists of my staff, not relatives. I‚Äôve always celebrated special days like Mother‚Äôs Day or Valentine‚Äôs Day with them.""


She continued, ‚ÄúThis girl [Pinky] has been with me for less than a month. She might claim to be my domestic worker, but I wouldn‚Äôt even call her that.‚Äù


Calling the accusation part of a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù, Pori Moni said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kept quiet on many things, but I don‚Äôt want small issues to uncover larger problems. I just want to live peacefully with my two children and this family.‚Äù


‚ÄúI have staff who‚Äôve been with me for years ‚Äì one has worked here for nine years, my driver has been with me for four. So many people have been working with me for long periods.‚Äù


About Pinky, she asked: ‚ÄúWhy would someone suddenly raise such allegations within a month? I trust the law. I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs done this, but I have all the evidence. I didn‚Äôt want to show them live. I‚Äôll handle this legally.‚Äù


The actress also expressed frustration over how the media reported the incident based on the police complaint.


‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt the journalists wait a little?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThey tortured me with the way the story was exaggerated, the way her interview was presented. Doesn‚Äôt that mean we‚Äôre giving her special privilege as journalists?‚Äù


‚ÄúJust because someone files a GD (general diary or police complaint) against me, does that automatically justify the claim? It‚Äôs not about me being humiliated or not. If I do anything wrong, I should face consequences,‚Äù she said.


She urged the public to refrain from labelling someone guilty before the facts are clear, saying: ‚ÄúAnyone can file a complaint, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you declare someone guilty before it's proven. Stop this media trial. The public is the real media.‚Äù


Pori Moni, known for her frequent appearances in the news, signed a new film titled Golap on Jan 31, where she plays the role of Rupa.


She has recently wrapped up shooting for Dodo‚Äôr Golpo, which is awaiting release.

" Hollywood eyes summer with anticipation, 50 years after 'Jaws' ","
                        
                        
                        A half-century ago, in June 1975, ""Jaws"" swam into theaters, gave audiences a good scare and rewrote movie history.
The shark thriller became the first summer blockbuster with a playbook that Hollywood studios still follow today.
""Jaws"" was heavily marketed, creating buzz that positioned the movie as a must-see event. It became a runaway hit that changed the career of its young director, 26-year-old Steven Spielberg, and shifted the scheduling of movies.
""Before 'Jaws,' there wasn't really a well-defined summer movie season,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior movie analyst at Comscore.
""You could have big movies coming out at any time of the year, but there was never a season that encapsulated what young people wanted to do in the summer, which was go to the movie theater,"" he added. ""It really changed everything.""
""Star Wars"" took the same path in the summer of 1977, hitting screens over the US Memorial Day weekend. Spielberg debuted his first ""Indiana Jones"" movies in June of 1981.
Now, Hollywood packs many of its most ambitious movies into theatres from the first weekend in May through Labor Day in September.
That season accounts for roughly 40 percent of the annual box office returns in the United States and Canada. In 2024, domestic theatres generated $3.7 billion in ticket sales during that time.
""The summer is what we look forward to in the movie business,"" said Doreen Sayegh, owner and operator of the five-screen Cranford Theater in New Jersey. ""It's when some of the hottest movies, the biggest blockbusters come out, and kids are home from school so we see a lot of families.""
Hollywood is counting on this summer to reverse a downward trend. Tickets sales in the United States and Canada are running 11 percent behind the same point last year, according to Comscore data, and remain below pre-pandemic levels. Cinemas face competition from at-home streaming services such as Netflix.
BIG SUMMER BETS
This week, movie studios previewed their biggest summer bets at CinemaCon, an annual gathering of theater owners in Las Vegas. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer reminded the crowd that ""Top Gun: Maverick"" brought in $1.5 billion worldwide in 2022.
""We're here to tell you that we're ready to do it again,"" Bruckheimer said, with Warner Bros action movie ""F1"" starring Brad Pitt as a Formula 1 driver. ""We believe this is going to be the cinematic event of the summer.""
""F1,"" scheduled for June, is among the few big-budget original movies in a slate of sequels, reboots and franchises.
Walt Disney's Marvel Studios previewed ""Thunderbolts"", the story of an irreverent team of superheroes starring Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. ""Thunderbolts"" will kick off the summer movie season in May, and Marvel will follow-up with ""The Fantastic Four: First Steps"" in July.
Warner Bros touted its new ""Superman"" directed by ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" filmmaker James Gunn. Actor David Corenswet will don the famous red cape for the first time, part of the studio's latest attempt to reinvigorate the DC Comics movies.
Comcast's Universal Pictures promoted a new dinosaur movie, ""Jurassic World: Rebirth,"" starring Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey.
One of cinema's biggest champions, Tom Cruise, teased ""Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,"" the film that may be his last in the action franchise.
FAMILY FILMS AND ACTION
Sayegh said she was optimistic about upcoming family movies including a new ""Smurfs,"" a live-action remake of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants."" Family films have been some of the top performers at cineplexes in recent years.
She also was impressed by the trailer for ""Mission: Impossible"". This summer, ""there's a lot at once, a lot of adrenaline. I'm pretty excited over the slate I've seen"".
Other cinema operators welcomed the full schedule after disruptions from the pandemic and the 2023 Hollywood strikes, though some complained that studios should space the movies out more. ""F1"", for example, comes out just five days before ""Jurassic World"".
As people weigh their summer entertainment options, Republican US President Donald Trump's tariffs have sparked fears of a global economic downturn. Any economic uncertainty from federal policies could create a challenge for the movie business, said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of trade organisation Cinema United.
""We're an industry which thrives on people having discretionary income,"" O'Leary said. ""When there is uncertainty in the economic markets, for any reason, people tend to not use that discretionary income as much as they otherwise would.""
When Hollywood starts to compile this summer's receipts, a familiar star will return to the big screen. Universal plans to re-release ""Jaws"" in theatres in late August to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

 'Iyanu' television show immerses audiences in Nigerian mythology ,"
                        
                        
                        Before Nigerian filmmaker Roye Okupe‚Äôs daughter was born, he decided that he wanted to create a character that would be a positive role model for her and people all over the world with first the graphic novel and then with the animated television series, ‚ÄúIyanu: Child of Wonder.‚Äù

‚Äú'Iyanu' is a love letter to my daughter, who is four years old now,‚Äù Okupe told Reuters.

‚ÄúBefore she was born, I had the thought in my head that if I eventually had a baby girl, ‚Äòwhat is a show that I would want to watch on TV, that she could both be entertained by, but at the same time, inspired by her heritage and her culture?‚Äô and that was one of the things that pushed me to create this,‚Äù he added.

The show, an original production by Black-owned studio Lion Forge Animation, will arrive on Cartoon Network on Saturday, followed by Max on Sunday with an all-Nigerian voice cast.

‚ÄúIyanu‚Äù is a children‚Äôs superhero animated series based on Okupe and artist Godwin Akpan‚Äôs graphic novel of the same name that takes place in a world inspired by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Africa.

The show introduces Iyanu, a teenage orphaned girl who discovers that she has special powers that will eventually enable her to defeat the evil forces in her homeland.

For Lion Forge CEO and founder Dave Steward II, the series based on Nigerian mythology is a sign that African content is becoming more popular in global streaming.

‚ÄúThis is kind of one of the first times you're seeing content coming out with African mythology,‚Äù Steward II said.

He added that it‚Äôs common for shows and movies to be based on Roman, Norse, and Greek mythologies, while seeing this level of African ‚Äúcultural specificity‚Äù is less common.

‚ÄúWe've had Black representation in different ways, in entertainment, in cartoons as well,‚Äù Sam Kugbiyi, who voices the character Toye, said.

‚ÄúBut to have it so specific, it's amazing. It's a beautiful thing to see. This is historic, in my opinion,‚Äù he added.

""Avatar: Fire and Ash"" is scheduled to debut in movie theatres in December, continuing the saga of the blue Na'vi people. Sam Worthington plays Jake Sully, and Zoe Saldana portrays his wife, Neytiri.

Cameron delivered remarks via video to the CinemaCon convention of theatre owners in Las Vegas. The Sully family ""are really put through the ringer"" in the new film, Cameron said from New Zealand, where he is finishing work on the movie.

""They face not only the human invaders, but new adversaries - the Ash people,"" he said.

""I‚Äôm sending you a reel to give a taste of the spectacle, and the increased emotional heart and soul,"" Cameron added.

Cinema operators are eager to show the next ""Avatar."" The first instalment ranks as the top box office hit of all time while part two is ranked third. ""Avengers: Endgame"" sits in between.

So far this year, overall movie ticket sales in the United States and Canada are running 11 percent below last year.

""I hope this film can provide a shot in the arm for theatre owners,"" Cameron said. ""We're still struggling after the one-two punch of the pandemic and streaming.""

Saldana appeared in person at CinemaCon and said the movie will also introduce the wind traders, ""a peaceful, nomadic air travelling clan.""

" India actor-director Manoj Kumar, known for work tackling patriotic and social themes, dies at 87 ","
                        
                        
                        Manoj Kumar, the Indian actor-filmmaker famed for imbuing his country with fervent nationalism with films like ‚ÄúUpkar‚Äù and ‚ÄúPurba Aur Paschim,‚Äù has died in Mumbai.

He died of a heart attack caused by cardiogenic shock at the age of 87 on Friday, Variety reported.

Kumar was nicknamed ‚ÄúBharat Kumar‚Äù (India Kumar) for his commitment to patriotic themes.

He was born in Harikrishan Goswami in Abbottabad, which was then British India, now Pakistan. His family relocated to Delhi after the Partition.

He studied at Hindu College, Delhi University, before entering the film industry in the late 1950s.

His early screen roles included ‚ÄúKaanch Ki Gudiya‚Äù (1961), ‚ÄúHariyali Aur Raasta‚Äù (1962), and ‚ÄúWoh Kaun Thi?‚Äù (1964). Kumar‚Äôs performance as freedom fighter Bhagat Singh in ‚ÄúShaheed‚Äù (1965) established him as an imposing dramatic presence.

‚ÄúUpkar‚Äù (1967) ‚Äî a film he directed and starred in, inspired by Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri‚Äôs slogan ‚ÄúJai Jawan, Jai Kisan‚Äù (Hail Soldier, Hail Farmer) ‚Äî was the movie that cemented his on-screen persona.

Kumar continued to explore Indian identity and social issues in a string of self-directed hits throughout the 1970s.

‚ÄúPurab Aur Paschim‚Äù (1970), ‚ÄúShor‚Äù (1972), and ‚ÄúRoti Kapda Aur Makaan‚Äù (1974) became cultural touchstones, blending mainstream storytelling with sharp commentary.

In 1981, he directed ‚ÄúKranti‚Äù ‚Äî a period drama about the Indian freedom movement that became one of the highest-grossing Indian films of the decade.

Kumar received the Padma Shri, India‚Äôs fourth-highest civilian award, in 1992. The Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award followed in 1999. In 2015, he was accorded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the country‚Äôs highest film honour.

Kumar was also a member of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Following Kumar‚Äôs passing, Modi posted on X: ‚ÄúDeeply saddened by the passing of legendary actor and filmmaker Shri Manoj Kumar Ji. He was an icon of Indian cinema, who was particularly remembered for his patriotic zeal, which was also reflected in his films. Manoj Ji‚Äôs works ignited a spirit of national pride and will continue to inspire generations. My thoughts are with his family and admirers in this hour of grief. Om Shanti.‚Äù

" Prosenjit Chatterjee‚Äôs son to make film debut, extending a family legacy ","
                        
                        
                        Trishanjit Chatterjee, the son of acclaimed Bengali actor Prosenjit Chatterjee and actress Arpita Chatterjee, is set to enter the film industry.
This marks the continuation of a cinematic lineage that spans three generations.
The news, reported by Anandabazar, an Indian Bengali-language newspaper, has already sparked speculation within the Bengali film industry.
While details about the director or his co-star of the project remain scarce, Trishanjit‚Äôs increasing presence at industry events has fuelled anticipation.
In recent months, Trishanjit has been spotted attending events both alongside his father and independently, with Prosenjit often sharing glimpses of these moments on social media.
Speculation about Trishanjit‚Äôs cinematic aspirations gained traction from the sets of a film directed by Srijit Mukherjee.
His presence there led to reports that he was preparing for his screen debut.
The Chatterjee family's deep-rooted connection to cinema dates back to the 1960s when Biswajit Chatterjee, Prosenjit‚Äôs father, established himself as a leading man in both Bengali and Hindi films.
Biswajit starred in celebrated films such as Dui Bhai, Chowringhee, and Shriman Prithviraj, and worked with icons like Suchitra Sen.
Prosenjit followed in his father‚Äôs footsteps, making his first screen appearance at the age of four in Chhotto Jigyasa (1968), where he played the son of Biswajit‚Äôs character.
His breakthrough came in 1987 with Amar Sangi, a commercial success that catapulted him to stardom.
Over the years, he transitioned from mainstream cinema to more nuanced, character-driven roles, particularly under the direction of Rituparno Ghosh and Srijit.
His performance in Chokher Bali (2003), directed by Rituparno, marked a turning point in his career, steering him away from formulaic blockbusters toward more critically acclaimed projects.
The 2010 film Autograph, directed by Srijit, further cemented his reputation as one of Bengali cinema‚Äôs most versatile actors.
Now, with Trishanjit poised to enter the industry, the Chatterjee family's cinematic journey is set to continue.

Paul Mescal will play Paul McCartney, Harris Dickinson will play John Lennon, Barry Keoghan will play Ringo Starr and Joseph Quinn will play George Harrison.

While the groundbreaking British band's rise to fame has been well-chronicled, ""I can assure you there is still plenty left to explore,"" Mendes said on stage to an audience of theater owners.

The four films will be released ""in proximity"" to each other in April 2028, Mendes said, adding that Sony executive Tom Rothman described it as ""the first bingeable theatrical experience"".

                        Oscar winner and former Bond villain Rami Malek plays an unlikely action hero in the espionage thriller ""The Amateur"".

The movie is based on Robert Littell's 1981 book and film of the same name.

The 2025 remake stars Malek as Charlie Heller, a CIA decoder with an IQ of over 170, who works in the deepest depths of Langley and lives in a picture-perfect country house with his loving wife Sarah, played by Rachel Brosnahan. 

Their happy life ends abruptly when Sarah is taken hostage and killed during a business trip to London. Grief-stricken Charlie tracks down the perpetrators, but to his astonishment his superiors refuse to take action. Charlie blackmails the bosses to get mission-specific training and sets out on a global manhunt to get revenge.

""I was watching Daniel Craig. I said, 'How do I get to do that?' I have to do it in my own way, and I'll have to do it in an unexpected manner,"" Malek, who played the antagonist Lyutsifer Safin in ""No Time to Die"", said as he premiered ""The Amateur"" in London on Monday.

""I like doing unexpected, unpredictable characters, playing them and creating them. And here's a story with one at the heart and centre of it. He has a unique circumstance he's been thrust into, and no one thinks he's capable of what he ultimately achieves. That's something that is extremely relatable to all of us,"" Malek said.

Malek, who also produced the film, said the themes of the original movie still resonate four decades later.

""It was a Cold War film, and I think there are elements of that period that still exist today. So I think it's a very relevant story. Any underdog story is pertinent to our time and someone who speaks truth to power the way Charlie does, it's important to have that thrown onto the big screen every so often,"" he said.

Veteran actor Laurence Fishburne plays Henderson, who is tasked with getting the scrawny tech whiz field ready. The two discover their differences but also a mutual respect over the course of Charlie's journey to avenge his wife's death.

""The audience can expect not to be able to figure this out. A lot of twists and turns,"" Fishburne said.

 Dua Lipa beats lawsuit claiming she copied 'Levitating' ,"
                        
                        
                        Dua Lipa won the dismissal on Thursday of a lawsuit in Manhattan accusing the British pop star of copying her 2021 megahit ""Levitating"" from a 1979 disco song.
US District Judge Katherine Polk Failla said L Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer failed to show ""substantial similarity"" between ""Levitating"" and their song ""Wiggle and Giggle All Night"", though some listeners could hear similarities.
The plaintiffs alleged that ""Levitating"" copied its ""signature melody"" from ""Wiggle"" and another song to which they held a copyright.
But the judge found that melody unprotectable in light of November's federal appeals court decision that Ed Sheeran's 2014 song ""Thinking Out Loud"" did not illegally copy Marvin Gaye's classic ""Let's Get It On"".
Failla also found several other alleged similarities between ""Levitating"" and ""Wiggle"" were commonplace, having appeared in Mozart and Rossini operas, Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, and ""Stayin' Alive"" by the Bee Gees.
""A musical style, defined by plaintiffs as 'pop with a disco feel,' and a musical function, defined by plaintiffs to include 'entertainment and dancing,'"" cannot possibly be protectable,"" Failla wrote.
To hold otherwise, she said, would ""completely foreclose the further development of music in that genre or for that purpose.""
Jason Brown, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said they plan to appeal.
""This case has always been about standing up for the enduring value of original songwriting,"" Brown, who is L Russell Brown's nephew, said in an email.
Lawyers for Lipa, her label Warner Records and other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
They called it implausible to believe Lipa, 29, heard ""Wiggle"" before writing ""Levitating"", and said the plaintiffs could not ""monopolise one of the most commonplace and rudimentary elements of music: the use of a minor scale.""
Brown's other songs include Tony Orlando and Dawn's ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree"" and ""Knock Three Times,"" while Linzer's songs include the Four Seasons' ""Let's Hang On!"" and ""Working My Way Back To You"".
""Levitating,"" from Lipa's album ""Future Nostalgia"", was the No. 1 song on Billboard's 2021 year-end chart.

" 'Khakee' reinvents Bengali identity as criminals, not cultural icons ","
                        
                        
                        Ever since the meteoric rise of ‚ÄúSacred Games‚Äù and ‚ÄúMirzapur‚Äù, Indian OTT platforms have been churning out crime thrillers in the hopes of replicating their runaway success. ‚ÄúKhakee: The Bengal Chapter‚Äù is the latest in this lineup, following the widespread acclaim of its predecessor, ‚ÄúKhakee: The Bihar Chapter‚Äù.

The plot is as predictable as can be. The story revolves around an illegal organ harvesting business in 2002 Kolkata, run by high-ranking politician Barun Roy and his lackeys. An internal power struggle starts within Barun's pet criminal gang, as gang leader Bagha gets framed by his own thugs, Sagor and Ranjit.

What follows is a classic tale of betrayal and aspirations, and staple crime thriller tropes: scheming politicians, honest cops, bromance between low-level crooks, secret informants, and a divide-and-conquer approach to tear down a seemingly unbreakable cycle of corruption and crime.

Despite the lackluster plot, what keeps the show going is the stellar star cast. The Kolkata-based show stays true to its roots, bringing together veteran actors of the Bengali film industry, like Prosenjit Chatterjee, Jeet, Parambrata Chatterjee, Saswata Chatterjee, and Subhasish Mukherjee.



Prosenjit commands an air of respect throughout the show as politician Barun Roy. His all-white outfits and salt-and-pepper beard manifest his evolution into an older, grittier character -- a stark difference from his ever-popular roles in romantic and art films. The seamless transitions in his personality as a devoted family man and a ruthless politician are a testament to the years he has dedicated to perfecting his craft.

Subhasish Mukherjee brings a similar duality to his role as the puppet chief minister, effortlessly shifting between the authoritative and spineless, depending on who's in the room.

Saswata Chatterjee is in his element as gang leader Bagha, a character he has perfected over the year ‚Äì from the cold-blooded Bob Biswas of ‚ÄúKahaani‚Äù to the eccentric Kartik of ‚ÄúBhooter Bhabishyat's‚Äù.



Jeet and Parambrata play two shades of the same role - honest police officers navigating a corrupt system. Parambrata has a more sensitive, emotional presence whereas Jeet brings his years of commercial experience in playing a headstrong, energetic officer, similar to the ‚Äúmassy‚Äù roles of South Indian flicks.

Chitrangada Singh as the opposition leader Nibedita sticks out like a sore thumb. Her role is reduced to appearing in rallies and speeches for most of the show, and her modern features and stiff body language feel out of place in 2002 Kolkata.

Off the top of my head, Rituparna Sengupta's larger screen presence would do wonders for the character. Casting her would have also strengthened the Bengali star cast, and revived the iconic Prosenjit-Rituparna pairing.



Newcomers Ritwik Bhowmik and Aadil Zafer Khan hold their ground strongly, especially Ritwik in his role as gangster Sagor, who is worlds apart from his portrayal of the soft-spoken classical musician Radhe in ‚ÄúBandish Bandits‚Äù.

Apart from the strong acting, the show finds its strength in its language. ‚ÄúKhakee‚Äù embraces Kolkata's natural bilingualism, seamlessly blending Bengali and Hindi without feeling forced.

The cast's attention to diction is commendable, as Bengali actors shed their stereotypical Bengali-accented Hindi, while non-Bengali actors like Aadil Zafer Khan deliver flawless Bengali dialogue. Sagor even calls Ranjit ""bhai-ti"", a colloquial Bengali term for ""little brother"", which has long faded from common usage.



Chitrangada, however, misses the mark once again, with her mispronunciation of everyday Bengali words. One can't help but recall Prosenjit's monologue about symphonies in the show, as if it was directed at her. She is, quite simply, the one musician throwing off the orchestra's harmony.

Kolkata, often romanticised as the city of poets, revolutionaries, and intellectuals, takes on a darker shade in ‚ÄúKhakee‚Äù. The setting is different from the usual OTT crime show locations, either set in bustling, urban Mumbai, or uncouth, poverty-stricken areas like Bihar and Haryana. The soft surroundings of Kolkata‚Äôs flowing rivers and polished architecture provide a much-needed distraction from the gory violence carried out by Bagha and his henchmen.



""Khakee: The Bengal Chapter"" is evidence that a strong cast can carry a show, no matter how worn out the plot is. More than that, it offers a fresh perspective on Kolkata, moving beyond its clich√©d image as a city of art and culture, and occasional petty crime.

The trailer song had it right, as this show truly invites viewers to witness ‚Äúek aur rang bhi dekhiye Bengal ka‚Äù ‚Äì a different shade of Bengal.

 Oscar-winning Palestinian director injured in attack by Israeli settlers released after arrest ,"
                        
                        
                        The Oscar-winning director of a documentary on the Israel-Palestinian conflict was released from detention on Tuesday, a day after being injured and arrested during a raid by Israeli settlers on his village in the occupied West Bank.

Hamdan Ballal, co-director of the award-winning ""No Other Land"", said he had been assaulted by settlers after filming them attacking a neighbour's house and then returning to make sure his own house was not attacked.

""I was just waiting outside, if any settlers or any army were attacking my home,"" he told Reuters after being released from police custody.

He said he had been pushed to the ground, while soldiers yelled at him to stand up and pointed their guns at him. ""It's crazy, you can imagine your family, your kids inside the home and you need to protect them,"" he said.

Shortly before the incident, in which he ended up being arrested by Israeli security forces, a group of settlers attacked a gathering for Iftar, the end of the daily Ramadan fast, at Susiya village near Hebron.

""Dozens of settlers attacked the gathering at Iftar,"" Jihad Nawajaa, head of the Susiya local council, told Reuters by phone. ""The young men came out to prevent them, and there were about eight injuries on our side.""

Israeli police arrested three men, including Ballal, who was injured during the standoff.

""This is not the first time that the settlers attacked our gathering, but in the recent period the attacks have increased,"" Nawajaa said, adding that the settlers had stolen around 10 sheep from the village during the attack.

Monday's incident was the latest in which Israeli settlers have been accused of raiding Palestinian or Bedouin villages and encampments in the West Bank, sometimes to steal livestock. Palestinians and activists who monitor such attacks say the police and army typically stand by without intervening.

Lamia Ballal, the filmmaker's wife, said settlers had gathered around the family house and her husband had gone outside to prevent them from breaking in.

""The settlers attacked him and started beating him, and then they arrested him,"" she told Reuters.

Anna Lippman, an American-Canadian from a group called the Center for Jewish Nonviolence, said her group had been attacked by settlers after arriving in the village around 15 minutes after the violence began.

'TARGETED'

The Israeli military said police and soldiers intervened after Palestinians threw rocks at the vehicles of Israeli citizens and later at Israeli security forces.

""In response, the forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation,"" it said in a statement.

It denied reports that at least one of the Palestinians was arrested in an ambulance.

Asked for an update on Ballal's condition and status on Tuesday, the Israeli police sent the statement first issued by the army the previous night.

""No Other Land,"" a film about Israeli displacement of a Palestinian community, co-directed by Palestinian and Israeli directors, won the Oscar for best documentary at this year's Academy Awards.

Ballal said one of the settlers who took part in the assault was well known to him.

""This is not the first time,"" he said. He has attacked my home many times and also has grazed his cows in the garden of my house.""

Basel Adra, one of the film's other co-directors, said he believed the settlers had taken the army to the family house as revenge for the film's depiction of the Masafer Yatta area near where Monday's incident occurred.

""Because he carries his camera and documents what is going on, I think he is targeted and he was avenged this way at night,"" he said.

European countries and the previous US administration of President Joe Biden have imposed sanctions on violent Israeli settlers, but under President Donald Trump, the White House has removed them.

 French actor Depardieu in court as trial over alleged sexual assaults of two women begins ,"
                        
                        
                        Actor Gerard Depardieu went on trial on Monday over alleged sexual assaults on a film set, in a case that placed one of France's best-known movie stars at the heart of the country's broader reckoning over sexual violence.

A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this is the first case for which he would be standing trial.

If found guilty, Depardieu could face a sentence of up to five years in jail and a 75,000-euro ($81,000) fine.

The trial, expected to last at least two days, and possibly more, was initially due to be held in Oct but was postponed due to Depardieu's ill health.

On Monday, Depardieu, his hand on his lawyer's shoulder, passed calmly past reporters, looking straight at the cameras without saying a word, before walking into the courtroom and chatting with a couple of actors present there.

He was expected to make a statement in court on the first day of the trial.

His lawyer, Jeremie Assous, told reporters that the accusations were false and based on lies.

""Truth is on our side,"" he said.

Prosecutors allege the assaults against two women - whose full identities have not been revealed - took place during the filming in 2021 of ""Les Volets Verts"" (The Green Shutters).

The prosecutors accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women, whom they named Amelie K, on the film set, pulling her towards him and trapping her with his legs before touching her waist, hips and breasts while saying obscene words. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say.

They say the second woman was groped by Depardieu on set and in the street.

'CINEMA GIANT'

Amelie K's lawyer told Reuters ahead of the trial that her client had been scared to come forward against Depardieu.

""There's a fear, because he's a cinema giant,"" said Carine Durrieu-Diebolt. ""It's a struggle between David and Goliath and they are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu.""

The lawyer for the second plaintiff did not reply to Reuters requests for comment.

Dozens of protesters stood outside the court, chanting ""We believe you"" to show their support for the two plaintiffs.

Depardieu's trial is the highest-profile #MeToo case in the media industry to come before the courts in France, a country where the protest movement over sexual violence has struggled to gain the same traction as in the United States.

Recently, however, there have been signs of a change.

Last year Gisele Pelicot became a global feminist icon after she waived her right to anonymity during the trial of her former husband, who was convicted of drugging her and inviting dozens of men to their home to sexually abuse her over the course of nearly a decade.

Last month a French court found film director Christophe Ruggia guilty of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was underage.

The accusations against Depardieu, and his trial, have divided French actors. Some have taken his side, and were expected to speak at the trial, while others have backed the plaintiffs.

Actresses Charlotte Arnould, who has accused Depardieu of raping her in 2018 when she was 22, and Anouk Grinberg, who played alongside Depardieu in 'Les Volets Verts' and has publicly criticised him over his sexual conduct, were among those present in the courtroom to follow the proceedings.

The Paris prosecutor's office last year said Depardieu should face trial over Arnould's complaint. Depardieu has denied any wrongdoing. It is now up to an investigative judge to say if there will be a trial over those allegations.

" Tom Cruise, Superman and 'Avatar' hold keys to 2025 box office ","
                        
                        
                        Tom Cruise takes on what may be his final ""Mission: Impossible,"" a new Superman will wear the red cape, and the record-setting ""Avatar"" sci-fi series will return to movie theaters this year.

Those films and more are giving cinema operators hope that the long recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue in 2025. Five years after the start of the health crisis, moviegoing has not fully rebounded.

Box office receipts totalled $8.6 billion last year in the United States and Canada, 25% below the pre-pandemic heights of $11.4 billion in 2019.

The film industry was disrupted again in 2023 when Hollywood writers and actors went on strike.

""That complex matrix of filmmaking, where everyone wants the best talent and the best actors and the best sets, it takes a long time to get that running again,"" said Tim Richards, founder and CEO of Europe's Vue Cinemas. ""2025 is going to feel the tail end of that.""

Top names in the movie business will gather at the annual CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas early next month to talk about the state of the industry.

The conference draws executives from Hollywood studios and multiplex operators such as AMC Entertainment, Cinemark and Cineworld as well as owners of single theaters in small towns.

At the Academy Awards this month, ""Anora"" filmmaker and best director winner Sean Baker delivered a ""battle cry"" for filmmakers, distributors and audiences to support theaters.

""The theater-going experience is under threat,"" he said, noting that the number of screens shrunk during the pandemic.

""If we don't reverse this trend, we'll be losing a vital part of our culture,"" Baker added.

Shawn Robbins, Director of Movie Analytics at Fandango and founder and owner of Box Office Theory, said the movie business was adjusting to ""a new normal.""

""Event movies are increasingly drivers of the business,"" Robbins said. ""There's even more weight on their shoulders in terms of box office dollars.""

Moviegoers still turn out for big-budget films, Robbins said, but have shown they are happy to wait to watch others at home.

""It is very common knowledge that a lot of movies will be available to stream within three to eight weeks, whereas it used to be a minimum of three months,"" he said.

'AVATAR' AS TIPPING POINT?

Among the big hitters coming to theaters this year are ""Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning,"" a movie that may be Cruise's last appearance in the long-running action franchise. ""One last time,"" he says in the trailer. The film will debut over the US Memorial Day weekend in May, along with Walt Disney's DIS.N live-action version of animated classic ""Lilo & Stitch.""

Brad Pitt plays a Formula 1 driver in the June release ""F1,"" and in July, Warner Bros WBD.O will release its new ""Superman"" movie directed by ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" filmmaker James Gunn and starring David Corenswet.

From Marvel, the anti-hero team ""Thunderbolts"" will kick off the summer moviegoing season in early May, followed by ""The Fantastic Four"" in late July.

Around the November and December holidays, offerings include the second part of musical box office phenomenon ""Wicked,"" animated sequel ""Zootopia 2"" and ""Avatar: Fire and Ash,"" the third film in James Cameron's ""Avatar"" series. The first ""Avatar"" is the highest-grossing movie of all time, and the second movie ranks third.

Robbins projected 2025 would end with a slight increase in domestic box office receipts compared with last year, ""maybe flirting with $9 billion."" He said it is unclear when ticket sales will return to pre-pandemic levels.

Richards said he believed the new ""Avatar"" would kick off ""an extraordinary three to five years"" for cinemas.

""We're going to see (Avatar) as the tipping point,"" Richards said. ""2026 has got an extraordinary number of great films.""

 LRB drummer Romel's new band set to bring Ayub Bachchu‚Äôs music back to life ,"
                        
                        
                        It has been almost seven years since the passing of Bangladeshi rock legend Ayub Bachchu. With his departure, the journey of iconic band Love Runs Blind, popularly known as LRB, also came to a halt. But fans of LRB and Bachchu continue to cherish their music, streaming their songs on YouTube and other platforms with the same admiration.

Now, after a long hiatus, there's an exciting update for LRB fans. The band's former drummer Golamur Rahman Romel is making a comeback with a new band, aiming to keep Bachchu‚Äôs music alive.

The band, ‚ÄúRomel and Friends‚Äù, plans to perform Bachchu's songs while also creating new music inspired by his legacy.

Their first release, ‚ÄúPaapi‚Äù, is set to drop this Eid.

Romel revealed that the band will follow LRB's signature three-guitar setup, a style popularised by Bachchu.

‚ÄúOur lineup was finalised a long time ago, and we have announced it recently. There is nothing happening with LRB anymore. This band was formed to keep Boss‚Äôs [Ayub Bachchu‚Äôs] songs alive. At the same time, we'll also create our own new music,‚Äù Romel explained.

As a former member of LRB, Romel felt a sense of duty to remind fans and listeners of Bachchu‚Äôs musical legacy, which led him to form his new band.

‚ÄúBoss was our mentor, and we all had a great relationship with him. Personally, my bond with him was very deep. He loved me like a son. I consider myself lucky to have spent over a decade with him, playing alongside him. I don't know how much of his essence I have been able to absorb.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut as someone who stood beside Boss, I believe it‚Äôs our responsibility to spread his music to an even larger audience. He always believed that anyone should be able to perform his songs. Whether others do it or not, I see it as my duty to remind people of his music,‚Äù Romel added.

When asked why it took seven years to form the band, Romel said: ‚ÄúWithout Boss, neither LRB nor AB [Ayub Bachchu] is possible. The two are interconnected. It‚Äôs not like it took us seven years to take his music forward. Romel and Friends is just a name. We‚Äôve been playing this music for years, keeping his spirit alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúLRB will always remain at the height it reached. No one can compose or create melodies like Boss did. But if we can create something even close, that would be enough. We will do our best in our own way. People all over the world have listened to his music and watched him perform. When they hear his songs again, they will remember him. This sense of responsibility is what drives us forward.‚Äù

Rommel said he always thinks of Bachchu while performing on stage or singing.

‚ÄúIt was a privilege to be with Boss. We shared the same dreams. If he were still here, our journey would have continued even longer. He is always in my thoughts.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur band doesn‚Äôt have a keyboardist. Boss used to perform with three guitarists. We are keeping the same setup. We are trying to maintain his style while performing his songs.‚Äù

When asked whether the other LRB members have welcomed his new band, Romel said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason not to ‚Äì we were always together, and we still are. Everyone is busy with their own work now. A few days ago, we released ‚ÄòInbox‚Äô, one of Boss‚Äôs new songs.‚Äù

‚ÄúRomel and Friends‚Äù features Romel on vocals, Julius Russell on lead guitar, Avro Roni on second lead guitar, Rashfi on bass, and Farabi on drums and management.

Romel himself has composed and sung their upcoming song, ‚ÄúPaapi‚Äù.

Speaking about the song, he said: ‚ÄúWe are releasing Paapi for Eid. The lyrics were created collectively, and the song will premiere on our Facebook page.‚Äù

Looking ahead, Romel band plans to create more music.



‚ÄúThis is our work, and we live on through our songs. We want to be everyone‚Äôs favourite band. Currently, there aren‚Äôt many shows happening as we aren't getting permission. There used to be more concerts in the past, but maybe, after Eid, things will pick up again and we'll get busier.‚Äù

Over a career spanning more than two and a half decades, Ayub Bachchu gifted fans with countless unforgettable songs, including ‚ÄúAmi Koshto Pete Bhalobashi‚Äù, ‚ÄúEkdin Ghum Bhanga Shohore‚Äù, ‚ÄúCholo Bodle Jai‚Äù, ‚ÄúEkhon Onek Raat‚Äù, ‚ÄúBaro Maash‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHashte Dekho Gaaite Dekho‚Äù.



Since his passing on Oct 18, 2018, his internationally acclaimed band LRB has remained inactive.

" 'Snow White' debuts in theaters, dogged by controversy ","
                        
                        
                        Disney‚Äôs ""Snow White"" reaches theaters on Friday, after having been dogged by controversies that dragged the retelling of the 1937 animated classic into the culture wars, potentially threatening its box office performance.

The big-budget adaptation of Walt Disney‚Äôs original princess story has been in the works since 2016, following a string of box-office successes with similar live-action remakes of Disney animated films, including ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Cinderella"" and ""The Jungle Book.""

‚ÄúThe Amazing Spider-Man‚Äù director Marc Webb agreed to helm a live-action musical version of the movie that would update the fairy tale for contemporary audiences.

The project, with an estimated budget of $270 million, has became mired in the nation‚Äôs divisions over race, the 2024 election and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Disney declined to comment for this story.

""'Snow White' looms as a Hollywood case study of how the world can change under your feet,"" wrote Richard Rushfield, editorial director of the entertainment industry newsletter The Ankler. ""It approaches the finish line having collected more scandals, brouhahas and issues than some studios see in a decade.""

""Snow White"" landed in the what Rushfield described as the ""culture war crosshairs"" -- a place it has worked to avoid since 2022, when it became embroiled in a dispute with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over a legislative effort to limit classroom discussion of sexuality and gender issues.

The film, like Disney's 2023 live-action remake of ""The Little Mermaid,"" attracted backlash for casting a person of colour in the lead role. Disney's selection of Rachel Zegler, an actor of Colombian descent, for the title role, prompted some online critics to deride the project as ""Snow Woke.""

The 23-year-old Zegler fanned some of the controversy.

The actor antagonised Trump supporters with a series of temporary Instagram stories posted after the 2024 election, condemning those who voted for the president-elect.

""May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace,‚Äù she wrote, later apologising for letting her emotions get the best of her.

Israeli-born actress Gal Gadot, who plays the film‚Äôs Evil Queen, provoked calls for a boycott of the movie after expressing support for her native country in the aftermath of the Oct 7 terror attack. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters faced off Tuesday, as Gadot received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Zegler, meanwhile, has been vocal about her ""pro-Palestine stance"" on X, taking an opposing view to Gadot on the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

Against this backdrop, Disney restricted interview access from the red carpet of the film's Los Angeles premiere, which was moved from Hollywood Boulevard to a tented area behind the El Capitan theater because of the Los Angeles Marathon.

The movie received an enthusiastic reaction at the premiere. Audience members applauded after many of the musical numbers.

‚Äú‚ÄòSnow White‚Äô is not only one of their best live-action remakes in years, but it‚Äôs also a film that recaptures the magic of the 1937 movie. Rachel Zegler IS Snow White, and she delivers such a magical performance,‚Äù said online critic Christopher Rates It.

Stephen Galloway, dean of the Dodge College of Film and Media Arts at Chapman University, said most of the social media controversies will likely be forgotten if the film receives strong reviews.

""The darkness of the web, even when it's not the dark web, doesn't kill a movie,"" said Galloway. ""Everything is basically dependent on, was this movie any good?""

Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory, predicted ""Snow White"" would open in the high $30 million to low $40 million range at domestic theaters. Other sources predict the movie will bring in $45 to $55 million in North America, and another $55 million globally.

""It faces these challenging narratives,"" Robbins said. ""The flip side is that family movies have been doing really well, and there aren't a lot of them coming out before summer so that could be a benefit.""

 Drake's label says lawsuit over Lamar's 'Not Like Us' should be dismissed ,"
                        
                        
                        Drake's longtime label Universal Music Group on Monday sought a dismissal of his defamation lawsuit over its promotion of Kendrick Lamar's Grammy-winning single ""Not Like Us,"" the biggest hit of a barrage of diss tracks between the two rappers.

In a filing in Manhattan federal court, UMG said the lyrics to ""Not Like Us,"" which according to Drake brand him a pedophile, are merely ""rhetorical hyperbole"" and opinion safeguarded by the US Constitution's First Amendment.

It also accused Drake of hypocrisy for having signed a June 2022 petition that criticised prosecutors using artists' works against them in criminal cases, and declared such works the product of artists' ""vision and imagination"" -- only to now brand Lamar's lyrics as literal fact.

""Drake was right then and is wrong now,"" UMG said. ""Diss tracks are a popular and celebrated artform centered around outrageous insults, and they would be severely chilled if Drake's suit were permitted to proceed.""

Lamar mentioned Drake by name in ""Not Like Us,"" whose lyrics say ""Drake, I hear you like 'em young"" and call him and others ""certified pedophiles.""

The song was released last May 4, one day after Drake's ""Family Matters"" appeared to accuse Lamar of physical abuse and infidelity and questioned the parentage of one of his children.

In his Jan 15 complaint, Drake, whose given name is Aubrey Drake Graham, said ""Not Like Us"" threatened his safety, led to attempted home break-ins, and forced the Canadian rapper to pull his seven-year-old son from school and the Toronto area.

The lawsuit seeks damages for defamation and harassment.

Michael Gottlieb, a lawyer for Drake, called UMG's dismissal request a ""desperate ploy"" to avoid accountability.

""We have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG's long history of endangering and abusing its artists,"" Gottlieb said in a statement.

Drake and Lamar, an American who won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, have feuded for about a decade.

""Not Like Us"" won Grammy Awards in February for record and song of the year. It spent two weeks atop Billboard's Hot 100 in 2024, and another week at No 1 after Lamar performed it at last month's Super Bowl halftime show.

UMG called Drake's lawsuit ""no more than Drake's attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle with Lamar."" Many commentators and fans also viewed Lamar as the winner.

The case is Graham v UMG Recordings Inc, US District Court, Southern District of New York, No 25-00399.

 Bollywood biographies: legacies of the families that shaped Indian cinema ,"
                        
                        
                        Over the last decade, Bollywood has seen more downs in its trajectory than ups. 

Box office failures have become increasingly common, with audiences growing weary of formulaic storytelling. 

This only got worse when the audience turned away from Bollywood towards punchier, high-energy South Indian movies.

Despite these hurdles, Bollywood‚Äôs star power has not diminished in the slightest. 

Viewers around the world remain deeply invested in their favourite stars, following them from red-carpet appearances to casual Instagram posts.

Even among the stars, certain families reign supreme. 



Yet, beyond the glamour of the Kapoor dynasties, the many Khans, and the ever-iconic Bachchans, there exists another kind of Bollywood family that has long worked behind the scenes, shaping the very essence of Indian cinema.

These are the true film families: the screenwriters who crafted Bollywood‚Äôs most memorable dialogues, the directors who revolutionized storytelling, the music composers who gave Hindi cinema its soul, and the producers who turned their ambitious dreams into reality.

Among them, the Roshans, the Chopras, and the legendary duo of Salim-Javed stand out as titans, their contributions transcending generations, leaving an indelible mark on Hindi cinema. 

Thanks to recent documentaries like ‚ÄúThe Romantics‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Roshans‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAngry Young Men‚Äù, these creative powerhouses are finally receiving their due recognition.



The Roshans, starting with Roshan Lal Nagrath, built a dynasty of musicians and filmmakers, culminating in Rakesh Roshan‚Äôs directorial success and Hrithik Roshan‚Äôs superstardom.


Salim-Javed, led by the formidable duo of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, revolutionised Bollywood screenwriting, creating some of the most iconic dialogues and storylines. 


Salim‚Äôs son, Salman Khan, became one of the three most influential Khans ‚Äì Bollywood‚Äôs biggest superstars.

Javed‚Äôs daughter Zoya Akhtar has made her mark as a critically acclaimed director, while his son Farhan Akhtar has excelled as an actor, director, screenwriter, and musician, making the Akhtar name synonymous with versatility and innovation in Bollywood.


Yash Raj Films, spearheaded by Yash Chopra and later his son Aditya Chopra, defined the aesthetics of romance and grandeur in Bollywood cinema.

The families often crossed paths. 

One such collaboration, the 1979 film ‚ÄúKaala Patthar‚Äù, is a testament to their intertwined legacies. 

A gripping drama inspired by real-life mining tragedies, the film brought together the music of Rajesh Roshan, the dialogues of Salim-Javed, and the direction of Yash Chopra, demonstrating the seamless synergy between these creative powerhouses.


The documentaries provide a raw and genuine glimpse into the lives of Bollywood‚Äôs most prominent stars. 

While these real-life stories lack the dramatic flair of fictionalised narratives, they are every bit as cinematic, depicting larger-than-life figures whose real-life journeys are filled with trials and triumphs.

The star-studded shows truly portray Bollywood as a ‚Äúfilm fraternity,‚Äù as actors, directors, producers, and musicians from all levels come together to celebrate the seasoned veterans, showcasing the deep sense of community in the industry.

What sets these documentaries apart is the way they fill viewers with hope and inspiration. 

They remind the viewers that the star families are not as far removed from ordinary life. 

Their rise to fame wasn‚Äôt handed to them‚Äîit was forged through relentless hard work, resilience, and an unwavering belief in their dreams. These stars, despite their fame, never took success for granted; they had to fight for it, and that determination is at the heart of their stories.

These shows do not only celebrate their achievements but also highlight their struggles, both professional and personal. 

‚ÄúAngry Young Men‚Äù explores Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar‚Äôs partnership, once considered unbreakable. 

Their partnership ended in a bitter split overnight, shocking the entire film industry.


Rakesh Roshan survived an assassination attempt, a stark reminder of the darker sides of fame. 

The incident was reenacted in ‚ÄúThe Roshans‚Äù, adding a raw emotional layer to their story.


These revelations humanised the legendary figures, proving that their journeys were fraught with challenges, much like the stories they wrote and composed.

Unlike most Hindi biographies, these shows make sure to highlight the often-overlooked contributions of the women behind the scenes. 

Female family members are acknowledged for their pivotal roles in shaping the family‚Äôs legacy. 

Rakesh and Rajesh Roshan, for example, spoke with deep respect about their mother, Ira Nagrath, a talented singer in her own right, who balanced her career while raising them after their father's untimely passing.


Salim Khan also paid tribute to his wife, Salma Khan, acknowledging her selflessness in keeping the family together, particularly through the challenges brought on by his second marriage to actress Helen.


Javed Akhtar took a moment to reflect on his enduring bond with his ex-wife, screenwriter Honey Irani, while also celebrating the life he shares with his current wife, veteran actress Shabana Azmi. 

Javed and Honey remain close friends, supporting each other both personally and professionally to this day.

Aditya and Uday Chopra shared heartfelt praise for their mother, Pamela Chopra, emphasising how her meticulous attention to detail played a crucial role in shaping the distinctive style of many YRF films, without which the studio's iconic productions would not have been the same.


Beyond personal stories, the documentaries subtly address the ever-present nepotism debate. 

While the successors in these families have undeniably benefited from their lineage, the narrative also emphasises the hard work and patience required to sustain generational success.


‚ÄúThe Roshans‚Äù focused on Hrithik‚Äôs journey, who debuted in Bollywood as the son of a successful director, but had to work relentlessly to establish himself as a superstar.


Salman Khan, once overshadowed by his father Salim Khan‚Äôs screenwriting legacy, built an empire of his own, while his brothers Arbaaz and Sohail could not step out of their comfort zone as supporting actors.


Uday Chopra addresses his career struggles personally in ‚ÄúThe Romantics‚Äù. 

The ‚ÄúMohabbatein‚Äù star reflects on his journey in Bollywood, where theoretically, he had every opportunity to succeed. 

He dedicated himself to improving his craft, working hard on his physique, taking acting classes, and even assisting his brother, Aditya, on his directorial projects to immerse himself fully in the industry.

Uday‚Äôs commitment is especially evident in ‚ÄúDhoom‚Äù, where he convincingly portrays a motorcycle mechanic from Mumbai. 

Despite being the son of one of Bollywood‚Äôs most renowned directors at the time, his fluent command of the street slang and the ‚ÄúTapori‚Äù dialect left no doubt that he was completely at home in his character.

Ultimately, Uday's career did not reach the same heights as his peers, leaving him with a relatively brief period in the spotlight.

Asha Bhosle, in ‚ÄúThe Roshans‚Äù, sums it up best: ‚ÄúIt is not usual for an artist‚Äôs entire family to turn out to be artists, but it happened with the Roshans.‚Äù 

The same can be said for the Khans, Akhtars, and Chopras, whose next generations are carrying forward their legacies, albeit in evolving roles. 

While Hrithik remains an actor, Farhan has branched into directing, screenwriting, and singing. Aditya and Uday have chosen to focus on production rather than acting.


In many ways, Bollywood mirrors these changes. 


Though it is facing a challenging transition, the new generation of filmmakers and artists are finding new ways to keep the industry relevant.

Aryan Khan, the son of Bollywood‚Äôs most influential actor Shah Rukh Khan, is set to make his directorial debut, signalling a shift where legacy does not solely mean on-screen stardom but also contributions behind the camera. 

Just as these great film families reinvent themselves with each generation, Bollywood too is ready for its next renaissance.

 Liam Payne fans dedicate commemorative bench in Buenos Aires cemetery ,"
                        
                        
                        Fans of British singer Liam Payne on Sunday inaugurated a bench in his honour in the British Cemetery of Buenos Aires, where the former One Direction singer died after falling from the third floor of the hotel where he was staying.

Benches in British parks and public spaces are often dedicated to lost loved ones, sometimes with personal, moving or even funny inscriptions.

""You and me got a whole lot of history, so don't let it go, we can make some more, we can live forever, Liam,"" the inscription read in English, a reference quoting the lyrics of One Direction song ""History"".

""It means a lot for the fans to have a place and bench in Liam's name here,"" 26-year-old fan Luana Bustamante said at the ceremony, which took place on a cloudy day and during which attendees placed a photo of Payne and flowers on the bench.

A priest was also present to give blessings.



""This is where Liam spent his last days in Argentina, in the chapel here which served as a refuge before he was repatriated to his native country,"" Bustamante said.

The 31-year-old artist was found dead on Oct 16, 2024. According to the investigation, Payne died from multiple trauma and internal bleeding due to the fall.

His body rested for some time in the British Cemetery but was handed over to his family on Nov 6 after the judicial system completed the toxicology and laboratory reports.

Fans also inaugurated a red mailbox to send messages to Payne's family.

""We know how many girls are going to come here and want to leave a message for the family,"" said Lucia Esquivel, 24. ""If possible we want to send them through the person in charge of the cemetery to the United Kingdom.""

""We hope with all our hearts this can be done,"" she said.

 Oscar-winning composer AR Rahman hospitalised in Chennai ,"

The 58-year-old was admitted to Apollo Hospital on Sunday morning, according to broadcaster NDTV.
Doctors have described his condition as stable.
He is currently under observation by a team of specialists and is expected to be discharged soon if his health does not deteriorate, hospital officials said.
His hospitalisation comes shortly after his return from London.
A spokesperson for Rahman refuted reports that he had been admitted due to chest pain, clarifying that he had suffered from dehydration and neck pain from fasting.
In a post on X, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin said he had inquired about Rahman‚Äôs health and was assured by doctors that the composer was doing alright and would likely return home soon.
Rahman shared the stage with British singer Ed Sheeran in Chennai last month.
He is currently working on the score for the upcoming film ""Tere Ishq Mein"".
The composer has won two Academy Awards for his work on ""Slumdog Millionaire"" in 2009 since his breakout score for Mani Ratnam‚Äôs ""Roja"" in 1992.
His celebrated career includes iconic soundtracks for films such as ""Dil Se"", ""Taal"", ""Lagaan"", ""Swades"", and ""Rang De Basanti"".
His work has transcended Bollywood, featuring in international productions like ""Million Dollar Arm"" and ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"". He has also contributed to Iranian and Bangladeshi cinema.

 'It's official': Will Smith's first album in 20 years to drop on Mar 28 ,"
                        
                        
                        Hollywood superstar Will Smith is set to make a long-awaited return to music.

On Friday, Smith announced that his first album in more than two decades, ""Based on a True Story"", will officially drop on Mar 28, Billboard reports.

‚ÄúBeen working on this project for a minute and I‚Äôm itchin‚Äô to get it out to y‚Äôall,‚Äù he wrote on Instagram.

Smith shared the news along with promotional images and the full tracklist for the 14-track album. The project features previously released singles, including ""First Love"", ""Beautiful Scars"", ""TANTRUM"", ""Work of Art"", and ""You Can Make It"". Fans can also look forward to exciting collaborations with DJ Jazzy Jeff, Teyana Taylor, and Jac Ross.

In a January interview with Billboard, Smith opened up about why he decided to return to music two decades after his last album, 2005‚Äôs ""Lost and Found"".

Reflecting on his journey, he described the creative process as deeply personal and transformative.

‚ÄúA well opened up inside of me, a well of understanding of art and pain‚Ä¶ all kinds of things that I didn‚Äôt even know were in there,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThen after the Oscars, that spiritual investigation continued and a whole world woke up inside that I didn‚Äôt even know was there. Dreams, visions; parts of my inner landscape that I had no awareness of prior to three years ago. And that opened up this bubbling to share what I‚Äôm seeing and experiencing, to explore.""

Explaining how his approach to music has evolved, he said: ""A big part of my music now is about that: the ecstatic kind of joy I remember from church when I was growing up; the ability to try to make this place more bearable. You know, I‚Äôve always had a wild imagination; that‚Äôs part of who I am. But there‚Äôs something new happening with me that‚Äôs demanding I explore musically.‚Äù

Smith also hinted that ""Based on a True Story"" is just the beginning, revealing plans for three albums under the same banner. He described the project as ‚Äúthree seasons of a TV musical show‚Äù, suggesting that fans can expect an extended musical journey beyond this first release.

                        The Emmy-winning comedy series ""Ted Lasso"" is returning to the pitch for a fourth season, streaming service Apple TV+ announced on Friday.

Co-creator Jason Sudeikis will reprise his role as Lasso, the American coach of upstart British football team AFC Richmond in the feel-good, fish-out-of-water story.

""We all continue to live in a world where so many factors have conditioned us to 'look before we leap,'"" Sudeikis said in a statement. 

""In season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to leap before they look, discovering that wherever they land, it‚Äôs exactly where they‚Äôre meant to be.""

""Ted Lasso"" won 13 Emmys including two for best comedy series during its three seasons from 2020 to 2023. Its future had been in doubt as the creators had said they originally planned for only three installments.

 Salman embraces the spirit of Holi with his new song ‚ÄòBam Bam Bhole‚Äô ,"
                        
                        
                        Dabangg megastar Salman Khan has embraced the spirit of Holi celebrations, appearing in a vibrant new song, ‚ÄúBam Bam Bhole,‚Äù from his upcoming film Sikandar.
The track, released on YouTube and other music streaming platforms, showcases Khan revelling in a riot of colours alongside co-star Rashmika Mandanna.
Written by lyricist Sameer Anjaan and composed by Pritam, the song adds to the growing anticipation surrounding Sikandar, which is set to hit theatres on Mar 30.
Even before its release, Sikandar has secured a significant portion of its budget, with its producers claiming to have recovered 80 percent of the film‚Äôs costs.
The action-packed thriller, directed by AR Murugadoss, was produced on a budget of 2 billion rupees, with an additional 200 million rupees allocated for promotions.
Streaming giant Netflix has already acquired the film‚Äôs digital rights for 850 million rupees, while satellite rights were sold for 500 million rupees.
Zee Music purchased the film‚Äôs soundtrack rights for 300 million rupees, bringing the film‚Äôs pre-release earnings to 1.65 billion rupees.
Khan, one of Bollywood‚Äôs most bankable stars, is reported to be portraying a dual role in Sikandar.
While industry speculation suggests that he has commanded a fee of 1.2 billion rupees for the film, such figures remain unverified.
Khan is known for negotiating a share of the film‚Äôs profits rather than a fixed remuneration like other Bollywood superstars, including Shah Rukh Khan.
His last major release, Tiger 3 (2023), failed to make a significant impact at the box office.
Since then, Khan has largely stayed away from leading roles, making only cameo appearances in a handful of films.

 Actor Aamir Khan confirms romantic relationship with Gauri ,"
                        
                        
                        Bollywood‚Äôs widely celebrated actor Aamir Khan has broken silence on longstanding rumours about his personal life, revealing that he is in a relationship with a woman named Gauri Spratt, a resident of Bengaluru in India.
A day before his 60th birthday, Khan disclosed his relationship status at a Mumbai hotel, marking the first time he has publicly spoken about Gauri.
According to a report published by NDTV, an Indian news media company, the two have been in a relationship for nearly 1.5 years.
‚ÄúGauri and I met 25 years ago and now, we‚Äôre partners,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very serious and committed to each other.‚Äù
The actor further shared that he had introduced Gauri to his close friends, fellow superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, at his Mumbai residence.
When asked for more details about his girlfriend, he said she works in a production company.
Khan also requested the media to refrain from publishing photographs of Gauri, emphasising his desire to maintain privacy in their relationship.
At his pre-birthday meet-and-greet, the Lagaan-famed actor also sang a few lines of the song ‚ÄúKabhi Kabhi Mere Dil Mein‚Äù as a gesture of affection for her.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if it is appropriate to get married at the age of 60,‚Äù he remarked.
‚ÄúMy kids are very happy. I am very fortunate to have such great relationships with my ex-wives.‚Äù
For months, speculation swirled over Khan‚Äôs frequent visits to Bengaluru.
Addressing this, he explained, ‚ÄúThere is less media coverage there. I used to fly there to meet Gauri.‚Äù
The actor also revealed that he had planned a dinner on Friday night with family members, where Gauri would be present.
Following his divorce from filmmaker Kiran Rao, Khan was linked to actress Fatima Sana Shaikh, though those rumours eventually faded.
Reports had previously suggested that he had introduced a woman from Bengaluru to his family, now identified as Gauri.
Khan‚Äôs personal life has long been a subject of public interest.
He married Reena Dutta in 1986, before his breakthrough in the film industry, and the couple had two children, Ira and Junaid.
Their marriage ended in divorce in 2002.
In 2005, he wed Kiran, whom he met on the set of Lagaan, where she worked as an assistant director.
They share a son, Azad Khan.
In 2021, the couple announced their separation, yet they have maintained a close relationship, collaborating on film projects, including Laapataa Ladies.
Despite their divorce, Khan and Kiran continue to be seen together at family and industry events, presenting a unified front.
For a time, rumours swirled that Khan was preparing for a third marriage with Fatima.
However, with his confirmation of his relationship with Gauri, such speculation has been put to rest.

 Hamilton impressed by Pitt's speed in 'authentic' F1 movie ,"
                        
                        
                        Brad Pitt's speed is real and Hollywood's F1 movie will be the most authentic racing film ever seen when it hits cinema screens in June, according to seven times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton.

The Ferrari driver said the Apple Original Films production had got the lot -- ""Brad Pitt, speed, thrills, an epic underdog story, drama, humour and a little bit of romance"" -- and would deliver on every level.

A two-minute trailer for 'F1', to be released internationally by Warner Bros Pictures on Jun 25 with Hamilton credited as a co-producer, provided a taste of the action on Thursday.

""Watching Brad drive around at speeds over 180 miles an hour was really impressive to see because it's not something you can just learn overnight,"" said Hamilton, whose season starts in Australia this weekend, in recorded comments at a launch event.

""The dedication and the focus that Brad put into this process has been amazing to witness.""

Directed by Joseph Kosinski of 'Top Gun: Maverick' fame, the movie also stars Javier Bardem as owner of a team on the verge of failure.

British actor Damson Idris is hotshot Joshua Pearce alongside ageing redemption-seeking racer Sonny Hayes, played by Pitt who is 61 in real life.

Shot at grand prix weekends, Pitt and Idris drove F2 cars adapted by Mercedes and kitted out with cameras and recording equipment.

The fictitious APX team had their own garage and pitwall with cars positioned at the back of the grid before the races started.

They had 10-15 minute slots for laps between practice and qualifying sessions, drivers ready to go with tyres warmed and cameras rolling as soon as the track action ended.

Hundreds of thousands of fans remained unaware that a helmeted Hollywood superstar was lapping in front of them.

Kosinski said Hamilton, 40, had shaped the narrative and also wanted to be sure, early on, that Pitt could really drive.

""If Brad can't drive, this whole film wasn't going to work, and what Lewis was very happy to discover was that, you know, Brad had a lot of just natural ability right from the start,"" he explained.

""I don't know where he got that... he rides motorcycles which I think has something to do with it but he's just a very talented, naturally gifted driver which gave Lewis a lot of confidence that we might have a shot at pulling this off.""

Kosinski said filming, with remotely-operated on-car cameras slimmed to a quarter of the size of those used on Top Gun, was ""like a live stage play... shooting at 180 miles an hour literally. It was an adrenaline rush every weekend.""

Pitt and Idris had months of training.

""When you see Brad driving, that's not acting. He's really concentrating on keeping that car on the track and out of the wall during all those scenes so that's something that you just can't fake,"" said Kosinski.

Formula One sees the film building on the hit Netflix docu-series 'Drive to Survive' that Kosinski first watched during the COVID-19 pandemic and is now in its seventh season.

""I loved how the first season of the show focused on the last placed teams, the underdogs, rather than the Ferraris, the Mercedes, the Red Bulls, the teams that you see at the front of the pack,"" he said.

""I thought that there was an interesting story to be told about an underdog team... just trying to win one race against these titans of the sport.""

 ‚ÄòNadaaniyan‚Äô: Ibrahim Ali Khan flatters to deceive in lacklustre romcom ,"
                        
                        
                        Dharma Productions‚Äô umpteenth high school romcom ‚ÄúNadaaniyan‚Äù premiered on Netflix on Mar 7. 

The film marks the debut of Saif Ali Khan‚Äôs son Ibrahim Ali Khan, alongside Sri Devi‚Äôs daughter Khushi Kapoor, living up to the production house's industry label as the ‚Äúflag bearer of nepotism‚Äù.

While many up-and-comers have struggled to shake off the stigma associated with the seemingly ""undeserved"" opportunities handed to children of Bollywood stars, recent hits like ""Maharaj"" show that audiences are overlook the nepotism allegations when an actor is truly dedicated to their craft.

Unfortunately, this is not the case for ‚ÄúNadaaniyan‚Äù, the watered down version of Dharma‚Äôs 2012 blockbuster, ‚ÄúStudent of the Year‚Äù.

The movie's plot is the same old wine in a new bottle -- so predictable that even the phrase to describe it feels like a clich√©. 

Khushi plays the role of Piya Jaisingh, a rich girl from South Delhi, who calls herself ‚Äúa poster princess of privilege and entitlement‚Äù. 

Ibrahim, on the other hand, is the outsider Arjun Mehta, who is lucky to be breathing the same air as the rest of his hoity-toity classmates.

Both of them study in a posh high school where the entry requirements focus more on financial status than academic abilities, except for a few exceptionally gifted students like Arjun. Piya hires Arjun to pose as her boyfriend on the internet in exchange of 25,000 rupees. 

The couple end up falling in love but struggle to navigate their confusing emotions, hurting each other in the process, only to get back together for their happily-ever-after in the last 15 minutes.

The plot is predictable, but even simple plots can often pass as a good watch, thanks to the acting or visuals. 

That is not the case for ‚ÄúNadaaniyan‚Äù, where the acting is as stiff as Ibrahim‚Äôs well-tones abs.

Ibrahim, a hand-me-down version of his father Saif, was the main attraction in this movie. 


Ibrahim frequently took to TikTok during the COVID lockdowns, sharing humorous videos that highlighted his acting skills. 

His body language while portraying two men arguing over whose lost wife to find first was a delightful nod to his father‚Äôs comedic style from the 2010s. 

So, his monotonous deliveries in Nadaaniyan disappointed many budding fans.



His dubbed voice was also noticeable, partly due to the low-effort post-production edits but also due to the audience‚Äôs familiarity with his voice, which closely resembles his father‚Äôs. 

But this decision to dub the actor‚Äôs dialogues may have come from a place of insecurity, as multiple videos of Ibrahim interacting with the paparazzi and his sister have shown him to have a slight speech impediment.

Khushi‚Äôs performance was consistent with her last three films ‚Äî in the sense that there wasn‚Äôt much of it on screen. 

Her expressions were lacklustre, to the point where it doesn‚Äôt leave much to criticise. 

She struggled to portray the ‚Äúpoor rich girl"" trope, which should have come a lot easier to her, considering her social background. 

At this rate, she is well on her way to wrest the title of Bollywood‚Äôs most hated nepo-baby from Ananya Panday, who at least has finally come into her own in her TV show, ‚ÄúCall Me Bae‚Äù.


A stellar supporting cast, featuring veteran actors like Suniel Shetty, Dia Mirza, Mahima Chaudhry, and Jugal Hansraj, were all in their element, but it did little to redeem the corny flick. However, Jaaved Jaferi‚Äôs son, Meezan Jafri, stole the show as Kunwar Rudra Pratap Singh. His cameo in the Tirkit Dhoom dance sequence drew comparisons to Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs iconic appearance in ""Mast Kalandar"" from ‚ÄúHeyy Babyy‚Äù.

The movie was riddled with previously successful Dharma movie references, so much so that they did a rehash of Archana Puran Singh‚Äôs role as Ms Briganza from ‚ÄúKuch Kuch Hota Hai‚Äù. 

It also has an overload of Gen Z terms in a futile attempt to make the movie more palatable to younger audiences. 

The trend is noticeably prevalent in recent Bollywood romances and was one of the main points of criticism for Khushi Kapoor‚Äôs previous movie, ‚ÄúLoveyapa‚Äù.

In the end, ‚ÄúNadaaniyan‚Äù remains a hodgepodge of everything and nothing. 

The out-of-sync dubbing got Ibrahim more flak than a few minutes of his stammering would have. 

Khushi‚Äôs focus on fashion and her figure has made the audience turn away from her as an artist. The movie even attempted to redeem its mindless plot by throwing in a few dialogues about toxic masculinity, but that was not enough to satisfy its ‚Äúwoke‚Äù audience.

The only silver lining of ‚ÄúNadaaniyan‚Äù is that it makes audiences appreciate ‚ÄúStudent of the Year‚Äù as an artistic masterpiece. 

The Karan Johar directorial faced similar criticism for its overly glamorous and unrealistic portrayal of high school romance. 

However, compared with the films Dharma has churned out over the past decade, ‚ÄúStudent of the Year‚Äù now feels like an intellectual, thought-provoking cinematic feat.

" Is ‚ÄòWith Love, Meghan‚Äô a final cry for attention by the Duchess of Sussex? ","
                        
                        
                        The fourth project from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‚Äôs Archewell Productions, titled ‚ÄúWith Love, Meghan,‚Äù premiered on Netflix on Mar 4.
The cooking-housekeeping reality show comes as the fourth instalment of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex‚Äôs $100 million deal with Netflix. While the first project, ‚ÄúHarry and Meghan‚Äù, was a big hit, the duo had little to do with it. The show‚Äôs success came from curious viewers looking to get juicy details of the ‚Äúroyal‚Äù family feud.
The two projects afterwards were banking on the retired royals‚Äô personalities instead of palace drama, which did not catch the viewers‚Äô attention and did not spark many opinions, either good or bad.
However, the banner‚Äôs last project ‚Äì featuring Meghan in a solo stint ‚Äì has outraged the audience with its exhausting ‚Äúhostess with the mostest‚Äù theme.
Meghan‚Äôs antics on the show are eerily similar to other tradwife influencers like Nara Smith and Nabela Noor, who receive their own share of criticism from the internet daily. But Meghan‚Äôs added flair of being a royal makes her more vulnerable to online trolls.
Meghan‚Äôs show is based on the simple premise of inviting other celebrities over to her Montecito mansion and spending the day trying out new recipes and crafting activities.
The show is supposed to be relaxing and aesthetically pleasing while highlighting Meghan‚Äôs sustainable, mindful practices in even the minute tasks of her daily life. But her lack of chemistry with the guests and exhausting attempts at being both relatable and aspirational have made watching the show feel more like a chore.
The show is full of yes-men like her makeup artist Daniel Martin and actress Mindy Kaling, who seem to be stepping around eggshells while talking to the duchess.
‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù star Kaling even gets reprimanded after calling her by her maiden last name: Markle, as the duchess sniggers, ‚Äúyou know I‚Äôm Sussex now!‚Äù. Meghan later covers it up with her spiel on how fulfilling it feels to have the same surname as her family.
Viewers criticised Meghan‚Äôs personality shifts between relatable girl-next-door and unapproachable royal. The debate sparked after she described her outfit choices as ‚Äúhigh-low‚Äù, mixing affordable high-street Zara trousers with luxury Loro Piana sweaters.
Despite her easy-going schedule filled with time-consuming hobbies like candle-making and beekeeping, Meghan puts up a show of her busy mom life. Although she has the time to cut out little ladybirds from tomatoes and olives, her busy schedule doesn‚Äôt allow her to cook full meals, so ham sandwiches and one pan spaghetti are the most ‚Äúcooking‚Äù she does on her cooking show.
Instead, her focus is on repackaging already packaged food into polythene packets and handwritten calligraphy labels. Throughout the show, Meghan‚Äôs beige minimalistic aesthetic pokes through, where everything must be neutral, pastel, and clinical. Her conversations are stiff and calculated, following her uplifting, mindful script to a T.
Even though her almost narcissistic traits have set off rumours of this being the couple‚Äôs last TV show, a certain group has embraced her programme with open arms. The purpose, however, may not be for housekeeping or crafting inspiration. Meghan‚Äôs show has become a prime example of ‚Äúrage-bait‚Äù, where people intentionally circulate content that elicits a feeling of anger in people, driving up content engagement.
Airing seven episodes worth of rage material from Meghan Markle has massively boosted Netflix‚Äôs engagement, regardless of the reviews. This may come as a silver lining to the duchess, as her five-year deal with Netflix is nearing its end. Perhaps the engagement from rage-baiting will be the trump card she needs to renew the multi-million dollar deal for another five years, finally revitalising her show-biz career.

" Drugs to blame in Liam Payne's death, close friend says ","
                        
                        
                        Drugs are the only thing to blame in the death of former One Direction star Liam Payne, according to a close friend who was cleared last month of charges he was involved with the singer's death.
Rogelio ""Roger"" Nores, speaking to Reuters on Friday alongside his lawyer, described Payne's October fall from a Buenos Aires hotel balcony as ""bad luck"" and a ""tragedy"".
Nores and two employees at the hotel where Payne died were cleared by a court in February of any wrongdoing.
Two other people remain detained awaiting trial over accusations they plied the 31-year-old Payne with cocaine during his stay in Buenos Aires.
""As a friend, you see them having a drugs problem and you do what you can but at the end of the day it's their decision,"" said Nores. ""You start seeing a chain of events and it was just bad luck, it happened in a way that ended in tragedy.""
Payne was known for his stint in one of the most popular boy bands of all time, One Direction, created by Simon Cowell from contestants on the UK version of TV show ""The X Factor"" in 2010.
Payne met Nores, a businessman, in 2020, later visiting him at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, according to Nores, a dual US-Argentina citizen.
""The last six months of his life we were together every single day, all the time, along with our girlfriends at that time,"" Nores said. Nores had last seen Payne that afternoon in the hotel, said his lawyer.
Argentine prosecutors had argued that Nores' closeness with Payne, and his alleged role as the singer's manager - a role Nores and his lawyer denied -- made him responsible for his death.
Prosecutors said Payne's autopsy showed at the time of his death he had ""large quantities"" of cocaine and alcohol in his system.
Nores' lawyer, Rafael Cuneo Libarona, said that Nores had sent Payne's family an email the month of his death recommending he be sent to a rehabilitation facility.
""It's hard for someone famous to say no to drugs,"" Cuneo Libarona said. ""Cocaine, 'tusi' (pink cocaine), crack, heroin are all drugs that are really accessible to famous people and there are so many dealers.""
""So let's not look for who's guilty, it's the drugs that are at fault,"" he said.
Despite being cleared by the court, fans are still upset with him, said Nores.
""When someone you grew up with, with their voice, their songs, and all of a sudden they're gone, it's hard to deal with,"" Nores said. ""They're trying to find an explanation.""

 Gene Hackman died of heart disease days after wife succumbed to rare virus ,"
                        
                        
                        Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's and died of heart disease and other factors likely days after his wife, Betsy Arakawa, died of a rare virus spread by mice, according to autopsy results released on Friday in New Mexico.
The 95-year-old Oscar-winning actor, 64-year-old Arakawa, and one of their dogs were found dead on Feb 26 in separate rooms of their Santa Fe home.
Hackman's heart disease and the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome that caused Arakawa's death were announced at a press conference at the Santa Fe Sheriff's office.
Hackman's wife died a week before he did, results showed. A reporter asked Sheriff Adan Mendoza if Hackman's advanced Alzheimer's had hindered him from perceiving her death.
""I would assume that is the case,"" Mendoza told reporters.
‚ÄúHe was in an advanced state of Alzheimer‚Äôs and it is quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,"" Heather Jarrell, chief medical investigator at the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, told reporters.
Arakawa is believed to have died around Feb 11, authorities said on Friday, citing the date of her last email.
Jarrell determined Hackman died on Feb 18, based on his pacemaker activity.
Hantavirus is a rare disease in the US, with most cases concentrated in the western states of New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah. In northern New Mexico the virus is predominantly spread by droppings and urine of deer mice.
The virus is often transmitted through the air when people sweep out sheds or clean closets where mice have been living. It begins with flu-like symptoms and can lead to heart and lung failure, with around 38 percent to 50 percent of cases resulting in death.
New Mexico has experienced between one and seven cases annually in recent years, according to health data.
State health inspectors found no particular sign of rodents inside Hackman's home but did detect rodent activity in structures outside the house, State Veterinarian Erin Phipps told reporters.
Hackman and Arakawa, a pianist, called Santa Fe home since the 1980s and were active in the city's art community and culinary scene. In recent years, the couple were seen less often in town as his health deteriorated. They lived a very private life before their deaths, Mendoza said.
A caretaker at their gated community discovered the couple dead. Sheriff's deputies found Hackman in the kitchen. Arakawa and a dog were found in a bathroom.
Both Hackman and Arakawa appeared to have suddenly fallen to the floor and neither showed signs of blunt force trauma.
Arakawa had picked up one of her dogs in a crate on Feb 9 from a Santa Fe veterinarian, which may explain why the animal was found dead in the crate in the couple's home on February 26, Mendoza said. Phipps said the dog may have died of starvation.
Hackman, a former Marine known for his raspy voice, appeared in more than 80 films, as well as on television and the stage during a lengthy career that started in the early 1960s.
He earned his first Oscar nomination for his breakout role as the brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow in 1967's ""Bonnie and Clyde"". He won an Oscar for best actor in 1972 for his portrayal of detective Popeye Doyle in ""The French Connection"", and in 1993 won an Oscar for best supporting actor for ""Unforgiven"".

 Keanu Reeves syncs up with creatives in motorcycle series 'Visionaries' ,"
                        
                        
                        Keanu Reeves was able to translate his love for motorbikes into the docuseries ‚ÄúVisionaries‚Äù where he and his business partner Gard Hollinger meet creative people from different walks of life that help them design the perfect motorcycle.

Reeves co-founded ARCH Motorcycles in Hawthorne, California alongside Hollinger in 2011 and had the chance to meet bike designers and inventors for ""Visionaries.""

One of the creatives they spoke to included a young man who built a space rocket using a giant 3-D printer.

""It's an extraordinary opportunity,"" Reeves told Reuters.

""We really hoped to inspire people with creativity and what are the potentials? And really championing creativity and creating, you know, championing people to create and to get over obstacles and to, you know, to realize dreams,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúVisionaries,‚Äù distributed by Roku, arrives to The Roku Channel on March 7.

Reeves and Hollinger curated the people they wanted to meet on their journey, with Reeves' favorite being James Turrell, a light artist who turned a volcanic crater in Arizona into a naked-eye observatory for the stars.

""I've thought about the skies and telescopes and the constellations, but someone to kind of create situations and mold a dormant crater,"" said Reeves.

""I guess a crater's always dormant in order to be a creator, but anyway, that to me with James Turrell was certainly remarkable,"" he added.

He also found being an on-screen talent refreshing as well.

""I love meeting folks and I love being able to speak. I love being able to talk to someone about their passion and their art and their craft,‚Äù said Reeves.

‚ÄúAnd the whole production company and the artists that we spoke to, they were very open to have that intimacy in a way to talk about passion and creativity, was some of the more profound experiences that we have in life,‚Äù the ‚ÄúJohn Wick‚Äù actor said.

 Three Bangladeshis make their mark in Australian film 'Hindi Vindi' ,"
                        
                        
                        The Indo-Australian co-production ""Hindi Vindi"" has released in Australian theatres, featuring contributions from three Bangladeshis in acting, poster design, and distribution.

Bangladeshi-origin actress Rupanty Akid plays ""Rihana"", a young Australian woman, in the film. Meanwhile, Sajjadul Islam Sayeem designed the film‚Äôs visual art and poster, and Tanim Al Minarul Mannan, founder of the distribution company BongOz Films, is handling its distribution.

Directed by Sydney-based Indian filmmaker Ali Sayed, ""Hindi Vindi"" has received positive feedback from both audiences and critics, according to Rupanty.

Speaking at a film screening in Sydney, she shared her excitement with Glitz, saying, ‚ÄúThe response has been amazing. Many people came up to me after the show, expressing their love for the film. They told me the story touched their hearts and that they could relate to my character, Rihana.‚Äù



The film‚Äôs star-studded cast includes Bollywood actress Neena Gupta, young actor Mihir Ahuja, and Australian singer Guy Sebastian, who makes his acting debut with this project.

Reflecting on her experience working on the film, Rupanty said, ‚ÄúThe entire shoot took place in Australia, and working with Neena Gupta and Mihir Ahuja was fantastic. Initially, some people were sceptical about my casting and acting skills. But after the film‚Äôs release, they were pleasantly surprised and full of praise. That recognition means a lot to me.‚Äù

Mannan, responsible for the film‚Äôs distribution, expressed his pride in being part of the project.

‚ÄúI first met director Ali Sayed at the South Asian Film Festival. When he shared the story of the film, I was immediately captivated. I love cultural films like this, and Hindi Vindi beautifully strengthens intercultural connections,‚Äù he said.

Mannan also revealed that ""Hindi Vindi"" has been released in over 40 theatres across Australia.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible to see Bangladeshi talents like Rupanty's acting and Sayeem's poster design contributing to such an international project,‚Äù he added.

The film follows the journey of Kabir, a young musician living in Australia with his father. One day, his grandmother travels from India to find him. Inspired by her words and cultural identity, Kabir embarks on a journey to learn Hindi to connect with his roots. He dreams of singing a song in Hindi for his grandmother, but the language proves challenging. His struggle to bridge the gap between heritage and identity becomes the heart of the story.

Mihir plays Kabir, while Rupanty portrays his love interest. Gupta takes on the role of Kabir‚Äôs grandmother, and Sebastian plays his father.

 Conan and Bond: Top takeaways from the Academy Awards ceremony ,"
                        
                        
                        Hollywood's biggest stars gathered on Sunday to celebrate the year's best accomplishments in film at the annual Academy Awards.

Here are some takeaways from the 97th Oscars ceremony.

CONAN'S FIRST OSCARS

Comedian Conan O'Brien hosted the Academy Awards ceremony for the first time, mixing his trademark self-deprecating humour with jabs at the Hollywood elite in the audience.

In his opening monologue, O'Brien poked fun at the typically hours-long Oscars telecast by performing a gratuitous musical number in which he sang about not wasting time but that included appearances by a dancing ""Deadpool"" and a piano-playing sandworm from ""Dune: Part Two"".

O'Brien also got political with a veiled reference to President Donald Trump as ""Anora,"" a film about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, started picking up awards.

""You know 'Anora' is having a good night. That's great news. Two wins already. I guess Americans are excited to see someone finally stand up to a powerful Russian.""

ORIGINAL SONGS DITCHED

The Oscars telecast scrapped the decades-old tradition of live performances of nominated songs. Instead, the ceremony featured several musical performances inspired by films.

The telecast opened with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo performing songs from ""The Wizard of Oz"" and two films inspired by the iconic 1939 movie - ""The Wiz"" and the two actresses' Oscar-winning 2024 hit ""Wicked"".

The show also celebrated James Bond films with a medley of songs from the famous franchise that included performances by actress Margaret Qualley and pop singers Doja Cat, Lisa and Raye. Later, Queen Latifah performed ""Ease On Down the Road"" from ""The Wiz"" as a musical tribute to producer Quincy Jones, who died last year.

NOTABLE FIRSTS

This year's Oscar winners included some notable firsts.

The nations of Latvia and Brazil each picked up their first ever Oscars.

Latvian director Gints Zilbalodis won the best animated feature film Oscar for ""Flow,"" which follows a cat that finds refuge on a boat along with other animals.

And Brazilian director Walter Salles' ""I'm Still Here,"" about a matriarch whose husband is taken away by the military regime that ruled the country in the 1970s, won the Academy Award for best international feature film.

Also, Paul Tazewell became the first black man to win the costume design Oscar for ""Wicked,"" an achievement he acknowledged when accepting his award onstage.

GENE HACKMAN TRIBUTE

Actor Morgan Freeman delivered a heartfelt tribute to his friend Gene Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner who was found dead at home last week.

""This week our community lost a giant and I lost a dear friend, Gene Hackman,"" Freeman said, noting that the two starred in two films together -- the western ""Unforgiven"" in 1992 and ""Under Suspicion,"" a thriller, in 2000.

""Like everyone who ever shared a scene with him, I learned he was a generous performer and a man whose gift elevated everyone's work,"" Freeman said. ""He received two Oscars, and more importantly, he won the hearts of filmgoers around the world.""

 Brazil's 'I'm Still Here' wins best international film Oscar ,"
                        
                        
                        Brazilian drama ""I'm Still Here‚Äù, about a matriarch whose husband is taken away by the military regime that ruled the country in the 1970s, won the Academy Award for best international feature film on Sunday.
The film, which also earned nominations for best actress and best picture, tells the true story of Eunice Paiva's struggle to uncover the truth about her husband's forced disappearance in 1971. It was directed by Walter Salles, whose 1998 film ""Central Station"" was also nominated for best foreign film, as the category was then known.
A number of Brazilian productions have been nominated in the international feature, directing and documentary categories, but none has won, although ""Black Orpheus,"" a Brazilian co-production with France and Italy, won in 1959.
The other nominees this year were France's ""Emilia Perez,"" ""The Seed of the Sacred Fig"" from Germany, Latvian animated film ""Flow,"" which also competed in the animated feature category, and Denmark's ""The Girl with the Needle.""

 Mikey Madison wins best actress Oscar for 'Anora' ,"
                        
                        
                        Mikey Madison claimed her first Academy Award on Sunday, winning best actress for her role as a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch in the drama ""Anora.""
The 25-year-old beat ""The Substance"" actor Demi Moore, Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, Cynthia Erivo of ""Wicked"" and ""Emilia Perez"" star Karla Sofia Gascon.
In ""Anora,"" Madison played an exotic dancer named Ani who gets married on a whim to Ivan, a member of a wealthy Russian family. Ivan's family does not respond well to the marriage.
Madison grew up in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles. At 16, she landed a role on FX television series ""Better Things."" She also had a small part in Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time ...in Hollywood"" and starred in ""Scream V"".
Her ""Anora"" role also earned Madison best actress honours at the Independent Spirit Awards and Britain's BAFTAs.

 'Time to go': Amitabh Bachchan clears the air on cryptic tweet ,"
                        
                        
                        Indian cinema megastar Amitabh Bachchan has cleared up the mystery surrounding his cryptic post on X, which read ""Time to go"", sparking frenzied speculation among fans.
Amitabh explained that he had written the post late one night last month while returning home from a film shoot, according to India Today. However, exhausted and half-asleep, he couldn‚Äôt complete the sentence, leading to widespread confusion.
In an upcoming episode of ""Kaun Banega Crorepati"", or KBC, a contestant asked him about the meaning behind his words.
As Amitabh began explaining, ""Time to go means..."", the audience erupted in protest, loudly declaring, ""You can‚Äôt go anywhere!""
Amid the cheers, he revealed, ""I usually finish shooting KBC around 1 or 2am. By the time I get home, I‚Äôm completely exhausted. That night, while dozing off, I wrote 'Time to go', meaning it was time for me to go home. I had work again the next day. But because of sheer drowsiness, I never completed the sentence.""
His incomplete post, however, had already sparked curiosity and speculation among fans.
At 83 years old, Amitabh remains as dedicated as ever, working alongside actors from multiple generations.
Most recently, Amitabh starred alongside South Indian superstar Rajinikanth in ""Vettaiyan"", their first on-screen collaboration in 33 years.
In addition to his film projects, he continues to host the immensely popular game show KBC.

 Shah Rukh Khan and his family are moving out of Mannat. Here's why ,"
                        
                        
                        Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan is set to move out of his iconic sea-facing home ""Mannat"" in Mumbai's Bandra, a place where hundreds of fans gather daily just to catch a glimpse of him.
After leaving Mannat, Shah Rukh and his family will temporarily relocate to a residence in Pali Hill, Hindustan Times reports.
The reason behind Shah Rukh's departure after more than 25 years is an extensive renovation and expansion project planned for Mannat.
The renovation work is expected to begin in May this year.


Since Mannat is classified as a Grade 3 Heritage Structure, Shah Rukh had to get court approval before making any structural changes.
Before the renovation starts, Shah Rukh, his wife Gauri Khan, daughter Suhana Khan, and sons Aryan Khan and Abram Khan will move into a luxurious apartment in Pali Hill.
Shah Rukh has rented the apartment from producer Vashu Bhagnani. For the four floors of the apartment, Shah Rukh will pay Rs 2.4 million per month.


The new residence will accommodate not just the Khan family but also their security personnel and household staff. Additionally, some operations of Shah Rukh's production house Red Chillies Entertainment will be managed from there.
Shah Rukh's security team is already working on ensuring the safety of the new apartment. He has leased four floors of the building -- the 1st, 2nd, 7th, and 8th floors, which consist of two duplex apartments, on a three-year lease.
It's not clear whether the family will stay in the apartment for the entire duration of the lease, but reports suggest that the renovation of Mannat could take up to two years.

 Demi Moore eyes Oscar with Hollywood comeback in 'The Substance' ,"
                        
                        
                        Demi Moore thought her four-decade Hollywood career might be over a few years ago. The actress, 62, battled negative thoughts about herself after a producer dismissed her as a ""popcorn actress.""

She took that to mean that even if her movies were a success, she was not worthy of awards recognition. Then came ""The Substance"" and her role as a fading TV fitness instructor whose injection of a serum for youth has gory side effects.

The movie tackles topics such as aging and self-doubt and, as Moore said at January's Golden Globes, moments when women feel ""we're not smart enough, or pretty enough, or skinny enough, or successful enough. Or basically just not enough.""

""I had a woman say to me, just know, you will never be enough, but you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick,"" Moore said.

During a May press conference at the Cannes Film Festival, actor Dennis Quaid described his role in the film as her TV producer as that of a cold-hearted male and Moore interrupted. ""I don't want to say that we're anti-men. We're just anti-jerks,"" she said.

Now, the star who rose to fame as part of the ""Brat Pack"" of actors in 1980s coming-of-age movies, is the frontrunner to take the Academy Award for best actress on Sunday. It would be her first Oscar after dozens of film and TV roles.

""Hollywood loves a comeback,"" said Ian Sandwell, movies editor at Digital Spy. ""They love to give an award for actors that have been known well, but have not maybe had the success that they deserved.""

Her early career featured two years on television soap opera ""General Hospital"" before she made it to the big screen in ""St. Elmo's Fire"" and ""About Last Night."" She was considered part of the ""Brat Pack,"" a group of young Hollywood stars seen at the time as entitled and unprofessional.

LANDMARK SALARY

In the 1990s, Moore starred in hit romances ""Ghost"" - the top-grossing movie in the United States in 1990 - and ""Indecent Proposal"" as well as military thriller ""A Few Good Men.""

In 1995, she became the first actress to earn more than $10 million for a role, for the story of a stripper trying to raise money to get custody of her daughter in ""Striptease."" That movie, and 1997 film ""G.I. Jane,"" were commercial flops.

After that, Moore took periodic breaks from acting, saying she had difficulty finding good roles.

She embraced the opportunity in ""The Substance,"" which required her to appear fully naked at times and to be transformed into a grotesque older woman through prosthetics.

When the performance won her a Golden Globe, Moore said it was the first time she had ever been honored as an actor. She also won a Screen Actors Guild Award for the part, and has talked about feeling humbled and grateful.

Celebrity stylist Alexandra Mandelkorn said Moore had been ""killing it"" during this year's awards season.

""I just love the joy that she's bringing into this moment,"" Mandelkorn said. ""The story of how she was really feeling, like maybe not that great about her place in the industry, and then to have this movie come out that really mirrors that story.""

Moore is favored to win best actress on Sunday, according to experts polled by awards website Gold Derby.

Her main competition is Mikey Madison, the 25-year-old who plays a sex worker in ""Anora."" ""Emilia Perez"" star Karla Sofia Gascon, an early favorite for the prize, saw her chances dwindle when some of her old social media posts sparked outrage.

The other contenders are Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, nominated for ""I'm Still Here,"" and Cynthia Erivo of ""Wicked.""

Winners are chosen by the nearly 11,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.

If Moore is awarded the Oscars golden statuette on Sunday, ""it would be a feel-good story, which I feel is what we all need right now from the Academy, and from just the film industry in general,"" Sandwell said.

 Actor Gene Hackman and wife found dead at home ,"
                        
                        
                        Gene Hackman, the intense character actor who won two Oscars in a more than 60-year career, has died alongside his wife, pianist Betsy Arakawa, and their dog at home, the sheriff's office in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said on Thursday.

The county sheriff's office said deputies had found the 95-year-old actor and Arakawa, 64, deceased on Thursday afternoon at around 1:45pm.

""Foul play is not suspected as a factor in those deaths at this time, however exact cause of death has not been determined. This is an active and ongoing investigation by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office,"" it said.

Hackman, a former Marine known for his raspy voice, appeared in more than 80 films, as well as on television and the stage during a lengthy career that started in the early 1960s.

He earned his first Oscar nomination for his breakout role as the brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow in 1967's ""Bonnie and Clyde."" He was also nominated for best supporting actor in 1971 for ""I Never Sang for My Father.""

It was his turn as Popeye Doyle, the rumpled New York detective chasing international drug dealers in director William Friedkin's thriller ""The French Connection,"" that assured his stardom and a best actor Academy Award.

He also won a best supporting actor Oscar in 1993 as a mean sheriff in the Clint Eastwood western ""Unforgiven,"" and was nominated for an Academy Award for his turn as an FBI agent in the 1988 historical drama ""Mississippi Burning.""

Hackman could come across on the screen as menacing or friendly, working with a face that he described to the New York Times in 1989 as that of ""your everyday mine worker.""

A method actor, he drew from his personal experience to flesh out a role. His characters were sometimes raw and violent and ranged from a small-town basketball coach in the 1986 sports film ""Hoosiers"" to Superman's archrival Lex Luthor.

He retired in his 70s, saying the parts he was offered were too grandfatherly. His last substantial role was in the 2004 comedy ""Welcome to Mooseport.""

Living outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, Hackman was married twice and had three children - Christopher, Elizabeth Jean and Leslie Anne, with his late ex-wife, Faye Maltese, who died in 2017. He married Arakawa in 1991.

The Academy Awards show on Sunday will offer ""community and an atmosphere of support"" for people recovering from the fires while also celebrating the top performances in film, Academy President Janet Yang told the nominees at the dinner.

""We simply must honour the talent - your talents - this year, as we have every year, as part of a tradition that is now 97 years old,"" Yang said. ""We must, because it brings so much joy to people all over the world.""

" Roberta Flack, American singer and Grammy winner, dies aged 88 ","
                        
                        
                        Roberta Flack, the silky-voiced Grammy-winning singer whose sultry ballads ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" and ""Killing Me Softly With His Song"" topped the charts in the 1970s, died on Monday at the age of 88, her publicist said.

""We are heartbroken that the glorious Roberta Flack passed away this morning February 24, 2025. She died peacefully surrounded by her family. Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator,"" publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. No cause of death was given.

The classically trained pianist defied musical genres as she blended aspects of jazz, soul, pop and R&B to create a distinctive style and became one of America's most influential singers.

Flack revealed in November 2022 that she had been diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive illness that impacts nerve cells and causes paralysis and death.

The singer won four Grammys and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020. She was the first artist to win two consecutive Record of the Year trophies for 1973‚Äôs ""First Time I Ever Saw Your Face"" and 1974's ""Killing Me Softly with His Song.""

""In more than a half-century of making music, she's established herself as one of the most distinctive song stylists in the pop arena,"" National Public Radio said of Flack in 2020.

Flack had several No. 1 hits in the 1970s and produced 20 studio albums. Although she wrote some of her own songs and collaborated on others, she considered herself as an interpreter of the music.

""When Flack sings a song, she caresses each cadence, considering and intensifying them, the better to realize the full meaning of the lyric,"" the Guardian newspaper said in 2020.

MUSICAL PRODIGY

Roberta Cleopatra Flack was born on Feb 10, 1937, in Black Mountain, North Carolina. She was one of four children born into a musical family.

Flack started playing piano when she was nine years old, encouraged by her mother, who was a church organist. She wrote the autobiographical, illustrated children's book ""The Green Piano,"" about her first piano, which her father rescued from a junkyard and painted.

The legendary singer finished secondary school at 15 and received a full scholarship to Howard University, where she majored in music. Initially, Flack wanted to be a concert pianist but then studied voice and aspired to be an opera singer.

She gave up her dream of attending graduate school after her father's death and became a schoolteacher in Washington, DC.

A perfectionist, Flack taught school during the day and sang in local clubs at night. American jazz musician Les McCann heard her singing at the Mr. Henry club in Washington and helped her sign a contract with Atlantic Records.

As an African American woman growing up in the South, Flack experienced racism and segregation, as well as challenges in the 1970s music industry, which was mostly male-dominated.

Her debut album ""First Take"" (1969) included the song ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face."" But the ballad didn't become a No. 1 hit until actor/director Clint Eastwood heard it on the radio and asked her if he could feature it in his 1971 film ""Play Misty for Me.""

Flack scored her second No. 1 hit in 1973 with ""Killing Me Softly with His Song,"" and her third the following year with ""Feel Like Making Love.""

She also collaborated with other artists, including Peabo Bryson, author Maya Angelou and Donny Hathaway. Their single ""Where is the Love"" was a top 10 hit and earned a Grammy for best pop performance by a duo in 1973. The pair also recorded other songs, including ""The Closer I Get to You.""

""A great collaboration is one in which the combination of two talents creates something unique and meaningful that neither could have without the other,"" Flack told Forbes in 2021.

The celebrated singer toured with jazz trumpeter Miles Davis in the 1980s and performed for the late South African President Nelson Mandela in 1999. The same year she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

She worked with the Alvin Ailey Dance Company and performed with the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra.

Flack, who was an inspiration for other artists, produced and arranged her own music and worked on scores for films and television. The singer released the soundtrack album for the 1981 Richard Pryor film ""Bustin' Loose.""

In 2006, she established the Roberta Flack School of Music at the Hyde Leadership Charter School in New York to provide music education for children. The Roberta Flack Foundation, which she founded in 2019, also supports music and animal welfare.

Flack married jazz bassist Steve Novosel in 1966. They divorced in 1972.

After suffering from a stroke in 2016, she gave up touring two years later. A PBS documentary about her life, ""American Masters: Roberta Flack,"" was released in January 2023.

""I've always tried to express myself musically from a place of complete honesty in the hope that each person can find his or her own story when they listen in a way that helps them to feel their own truth,"" she told Forbes.

 Not Ranbir or Ayushmann: Sourav Ganguly names actor who'll play the role of 'Dada' in biopic ,"
                        
                        
                        Rumours about a biopic on Indian cricketer Sourav Ganguly have been circulating for years, and it now appears set to come out of the pipeline.
Initially, it was reported that Sourav, popularly known as ""Dada"", had approved the script, and actor Ranbir Kapoor was set to play the lead role. But after the ""Sanju"" star revealed he had not been offered the role, reports emerged that Ayushmann Khurrana had been roped in for the part.
Now, the latest update reveals that neither Ranbir nor Khurrana will play the role. Instead, Rajkummar Rao has been chosen to portray ""Dada"" on the big screen.
Sourav himself confirmed the development, according to Indian media outlet Mint.
Asked about the biopic during an event in Bardhaman, Sourav said, ‚ÄúFrom what I've heard, Rajkummar Rao will play the [titular] role... But there are issues of dates... So it will take more than a year to hit the screens.""
Rajkummar was recently seen in the blockbuster horror-comedy ""Stree 2"". Mint reports that Rajkummar already has several projects lined up, and the biopic‚Äôs script is still being finalised. If everything goes as planned, filming for the movie could start in July.
Previously, biopics like MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Sachin: A Billion Dreams, and Azhar, based on cricketers Dhoni, Tendulkar, and Azharuddin, had made
Sourav Ganguly‚Äôs biopic will go beyond his 18,575 international runs, shedding light on his aggressive captaincy and impact on Indian cricket, according to Mint.
The southpaw represented India in 113 Tests and 311 ODIs, amassing an impressive 18,575 runs across all formats. After his playing career, he took on leadership roles in cricket administration, first as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal and later as the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
Reports suggest that pre-production work has already begun, with filmmakers meeting Sourav at Kolkata's Eden Gardens.
While the project is still in its early stages, IMDb has reported that the biopic will be directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, with the script penned by Abhay Koranne.
It comes on the heels of recent biographical sports drama films such as ""MS Dhoni: The Untold Story"", ""83"" and ""Azhar"", which generated a lot of buzz in the box office.

" 'Conclave,' Chalamet win at SAG Awards, setting up Oscars battle ","
                        
                        
                        Papal thriller ""Conclave"" claimed the top prize on Sunday at Hollywood's Screen Actors Guild Awards, and Timothee Chalamet's portrayal of Bob Dylan made him the surprise best actor winner, at the last major honours ahead of next weekend's Oscars.

The ""Conclave"" cast of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini won best movie ensemble at the SAG Awards, a red-carpet ceremony that streamed live on Netflix. The film tells the story of the secret manoeuvring at the Vatican during the selection of a fictional pope.

Fiennes spoke on behalf of the cast about the need for supportive communities, in filmmaking and in life, as he accepted the SAG trophy on stage in downtown Los Angeles.

""We do recognise the supreme importance of (community) in our work and in the world,"" Fiennes said. ""That's what we're celebrating tonight.""

""Conclave"" was feted as the real-life pope, 88-year-old Pope Francis, remained in critical condition with double pneumonia. Italian actress Rossellini wished him well during and after the ceremony.



""We are very, very worried for our pope,"" she told reporters after the SAG event. ""We love this pope.""

The ""Conclave"" win signalled the movie could take the prestigious best picture trophy at the Academy Awards on Mar 2. Members of the SAG-AFTRA actors union pick the SAG winners, and actors form the largest voting body for the Oscars.

But the race for best picture at the Oscars is unusually murky this year.

While ""Conclave"" also captured the top prize at the Britain's BAFTA awards, the big trophies from Hollywood producers and directors went to ""Anora,"" a drama about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch.

Chalamet scored the SAG award for best movie actor for playing a young Dylan as he arrives in New York to try to make it in music in ""A Complete Unknown.""

The outcome was an upset over Adrien Brody, who landed several acting trophies earlier in the season for playing an immigrant and architect in ""The Brutalist.""

The 29-year-old Chalamet said he ""poured everything I had"" into his portrayal of Dylan.

""The truth is, I'm really in pursuit of greatness,"" Chalamet said. ""I want to be one of the greats.""

Demi Moore was honoured as best movie actress for her role as a fading celebrity seeking a fountain of youth in ""The Substance."" The actress recalled getting her SAG union card in 1978 at age 15.

""It changed my life because it gave me meaning, it gave me purpose and it gave me direction,"" she said. ""I was a kid on my own who had no blueprint for life.""

The supporting movie actor and actress trophies went to Kieran Culkin for ""A Real Pain"" and Zoe Saldana for ""Emilia Perez.""

In television honours, the cast of FX's ""Shogun,"" a tale of political machinations in imperial Japan, was named best ensemble in a drama. ""Only Murders in the Building"" won best ensemble in a comedy series for stars including Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin.

""Wait, we never win. This is so weird,"" a surprised Gomez said. ""Marty and Steve aren't here because, you know, they don't really care,"" she added, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Actor and activist Jane Fonda was honored with a life achievement award and talked about the empathy that actors draw upon in their performances.

""Empathy is not weak or woke,"" she said, ""and by the way, woke just means you give a damn about other people.""

""Shogun"" follows the character Lord Yoshii Toranag, as he discovers secrets that can help him destroy his enemies.

A tale of political machinations, ""Shogun,"" also won best female actor in a drama series and best male in a drama series awards for first-time winners Anna Sawai and Sanada.

""Very happy, but I'm also kind of sad, because this is probably the last time I'm able to celebrate the work with you guys. I love you, the whole FX team,"" Sawai said with tears rolling down her cheeks.

Sanada, also emotional, reflected on his acting journey.

""I started acting in Japan when I was five years old, and moved to LA 20 years ago, and luckily, I worked with great filmmakers and actors,"" Sanada said.

""I put everything, every single experience in my life into ""Shogun"" then ""Shogun"" brought me here,"" he added.

The ""Only Murders in the Building"" team was surprised by their win, which beat out frontrunners ""The Bear"" and ""Hacks.""

""We never win. This is so weird,"" Selena Gomez said.

""I'm taking it home for all of us and bringing this back to New York,"" she added.

Jessica Gunning won best actor in a television movie or limited series for her role in the Netflix series ""Baby Reindeer"" as stalker Martha Scott.

She recalled creating a PowerPoint vision board when she was working a desk job while acting on the side about eight years ago.

""It was like a kind of positive thinking vision board of all the things I wanted to do and the people I wanted to meet and work with,"" Gunning said.

""And Cate Blanchard and Jodie Foster and Kathy Bates were on that vision board,"" she added, noting the feeling of honour she felt to be nominated alongside them and then winning the category.

Colin Farrell took home the best actor in a television movie or limited series award for his role at the title character in the HBO Max series ""The Penguin,"" which had him reflecting on what it means to him to be an actor.

""The beautiful thing, and the annoying thing, about what we do, it's just unquantifiable,"" he said.

 Animated films seek to find a place in best picture Oscar race ,"
                        
                        
                        ""Inside Out 2"" was the highest grossing film of 2024 and is the highest grossing animated film of all time, but it was shut out of the best picture Oscar race along with acclaimed animated films ""The Wild Robot"" and ""Flow.""

Animated filmmakers now aim to be included to the best picture race after being shut out for several years.

""In general, animation is just in its little corner on its own, so we'd love to champion it to be considered for best film,"" said Merlin Crossingham, who co-directed ""Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.""

Among the top 10 grossing films in 2024, five were animated sequel movies: Disney's ""Moana 2"" and ""Mufasa: The Lion King,"" Universal Pictures' and DreamWorks' ""Kung Fu Panda 4,"" and Universal Pictures ""Despicable Me 4,"" Box Office Mojo said.

""I think more and more that we're being considered in that area, it's a little bit of a glass ceiling for us,"" said Bonnie Arnold, veteran film executive who worked for Disney Animation, Pixar Animation and DreamWorks Animation.

While there have been some animated films nominated for best picture, including ""Beauty and the Beast"" in 1991, ""Up"" in 2009 and ""Toy Story 3"" in 2010, they have been overlooked in recent years.

There is a stigma that animated films are just for children, rather than audiences of all ages.

Arnold also said that while animated theatrical releases are frequently family-oriented in her opinion, versus adult animation with a stronger streaming presence, she does not believe family inclusive elements limit audience.

By contrast, ""Inside Out"" director Peter Docter believes that sometimes animated films do not meet the expectations of a best picture contender due to low humour.

""There is a certain calibre that people are looking for in a best picture, so we gotta step it up,"" Docter told Reuters.

Breaking those barriers, Screen Australia's adult stop-motion animated film ""Memoir of a Snail"" is the second R-rated animated film ever to receive an Oscar nomination.

The movie follows a girl named Grace growing up in 1970s Melbourne, Australia, as she uses an obsession with snails to cope with the traumas of life.

LANDING HIGH SCORES

The 2024 Disney and Pixar movie ""Inside Out 2"" crossed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office in less than three weeks of its release, reaching that level in the fastest time of any animated film in history.

""Inside Out 2"" is a sequel to Docter's 2015 film, which follows five humanoid emotions inside the mind of a girl named Riley.

For ""Inside Out 2"" director Kelsey Mann, the sequel was successful due to encouragement from Docter.

""He (Docter) said 'the sooner you start thinking of this film as an original, the better off you're going to be' and I really took that to heart,"" Mann added.

By contrast, the DreamWorks Oscar contender ""The Wild Robot"" introduces a new cinematic story based on a 2016 novel, written and directed by industry veteran Sanders.

""The Wild Robot"" has received high acclaim, including a 97 percent on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

The movie follows a service robot named Roz who is shipwrecked on an island, eventually becoming the adoptive mother to an orphaned goose.

For Sanders, who worked on successful animated films ""Lilo and Stitch"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" ""The Wild Robot"" was an opportunity to revisit raw aesthetics.

""The Wild Robot"" incorporated ""beautiful painted characters and painted backgrounds"" that do not tend to make it into CGI movies.

LATVIA'S 'FLOW' IS CONTENDER

One film that has become an unexpected contender is the Latvian independent animated film, ""Flow.""

The movie is a standout in the 2024 season having no dialogue.

""Flow"" follows a cat that finds refuge on a boat along with other animals that work together after a flood has destroyed their homes.

""Flow"" entered the Oscar race after big studio films like ""Inside Out 2,"" ""Moana 2"" and ""The Wild Robot,"" which all had higher box office numbers, lost the Golden Globe to the small independent film.

The ""Flow"" team transformed its smaller budget into a best international film Oscar nominee, getting rare recognition for an animated film within two major categories and making history with the first Oscar nominations for Latvia ever.

Despite obstacles, animation filmmakers are hopeful for the future.

The ""Chicken Run"" filmmakers noted progress with the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) nomination for Best British Film that put ""Wallace and Gromit"" up against live-action films.

""Wallace and Gromit"" has a 100 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes.

                        Private television channels in Bangladesh usually release special single-episode dramas to mark International Mother Language Day. On the 73rd anniversary of the Language Movement protests, however, major networks like Banglavision, NTV, Deepto and ATN Bangla have scheduled various programmes, but have not produced any new dramas.
Meanwhile, channels such as Maasranga, Duronto, Boishakhi and RTV are only re-airing old Ekushey-themed dramas, drawing criticism from industry professionals and audiences alike.
Several directors, including Simanto Sajal and Tuhin Hossain, have expressed frustration over TV stations' reluctance to invest in new productions for the occasion.
According to these filmmakers, while they are eager to create dramas for special occasions, a lack of sponsorship remains a major obstacle.
On the other hand, TV station officials argue that aside from airing these dramas on television, they also upload them to YouTube. They claim viewership for special shows on social media has declined, and with shrinking ad revenue and fewer investors, producing new dramas is no longer financially viable.
Actors have also voiced disappointment over the absence of new Ekushey dramas, stressing that to keep the spirit of the momentous day alive, fresh productions are necessary.
They urged TV stations to look beyond mere viewership metrics and focus on creating content that upholds cultural values.
Viewers, too, have noticed a steady decline in the number of dramas based on the Language Movement.
As part of its special programming, Maasranga TV will broadcast ""Bornomalar Michhil"" at 10:30pm. The drama, written and directed by Sajal, originally aired in 2019.
Unaware of its re-airing, Sajal expressed his disappointment and said, ‚ÄúI just found out that my drama is being re-broadcast. If the channel had informed me, I could have promoted it. ‚ÄòBornomalar Michhil‚Äô has already been watched by many. Rather than replaying old dramas, we should focus on producing new ones.‚Äù
Despite his passion for productions marking special days, Sajal pointed out that securing a producer is always a challenge.
‚ÄúI have always been eager to work on Language Day dramas. Bornomalar Michhil was my first TV drama, which I self-financed and provided to the station. Now, with more experience, I would love to create even better productions. But lack of sponsorship makes it impossible,‚Äù he said.
On the reluctance of producers to support such efforts, he added: ‚ÄúWhen we pitch our ideas to producers or TV channels, they often dismiss them, saying special-day dramas don‚Äôt generate enough views. We keep trying, but they remain adamant.‚Äù
Duronto TV will air ""Jhutum Pakhir Kotha"", another drama that premiered in 2019 and has been re-aired multiple times.
Similarly, Boishakhi TV will show ""Bhasha O Bhalobasha"" from 2017, while RTV will rerun ""Borno"" from 2021.
Asked about the re-airing of old dramas, director Monirul Hossain Shipon said, ‚ÄúDuronto TV balances both new and old programmes. The storyline of the drama remains relevant, which is why it‚Äôs being aired again.‚Äù
However, Shipon also pointed out that while there are many untold stories about the Language Movement, TV channels show little interest in producing new dramas.
‚ÄúTV stations prioritise Eid dramas. They‚Äôve never been very keen on making productions for other special occasions. However, I believe this needs to change,‚Äù he added.
Director Tuhin Hossain, who has been making dramas for 14 years, has always produced special programmes for Language Day. However, for the first time, he has no new drama lined up this year.
Frustrated with the neglect of occasion-based productions, he said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed that I couldn‚Äôt make a drama this year. It‚Äôs not just about Language Day -- even on Victory Day, new productions are rare. This growing disregard for occasion-centric dramas is concerning. If we want to preserve the spirit of Ekushey, we must increase these productions.‚Äù
Asked whether producers approach him for such projects, Tuhin replied: ‚ÄúOf course, I would love to make them. But television channels now have a YouTube-driven business model. Their business depends on social media views. They believe if they upload these dramas to YouTube, their target audience won‚Äôt watch them.‚Äù
He suggested that the government should make it mandatory for TV stations to produce dramas for special occasions.
WHY TV STATIONS SHY AWAY FROM NEW PRODUCTIONS
Television executives and producers cite financial challenges as the main reason for re-airing old dramas on International Mother Language Day.
Riyad Shimul, assistant manager of Maasranga TV‚Äôs programming department, explained that while they strive to produce new dramas for special occasions, funding issues often make it difficult. In the past, these productions received strong support from sponsors, but in recent years, both sponsorships and advertising revenue have declined, creating a financial gap.
As a result, some years see new productions, while others rely on re-airing old dramas. Shimul admitted that the decline in occasion-based dramas is disappointing even for the industry itself.
He also pointed out that casting popular actors, who generally attract more viewers, greatly increases production costs. Additionally, many artists are reluctant to participate in such projects, believing that these dramas won‚Äôt draw large audiences, especially in today‚Äôs highly competitive viewership landscape.
To revive special-occasion dramas, Saju Muntasher, former general secretary of the Television Program Producers Association of Bangladesh, suggested that the government should require TV channels to produce at least one new drama for key national days such as Feb 21, Independence Day and Victory Day. He argued that television channel owners have the financial means to support such productions and should not rely entirely on sponsorships.
'DEEPLY DISHEARTENING'
Veteran actor Tariq Anam Khan, who starred in ""Bornomalar Michhil"" six years ago, has not appeared in any new productions for this year‚Äôs International Mother Language Day. When asked about the importance of new dramas for such occasions, he emphasised that they are essential.
He described Language Day as a matter of national pride and heritage, highlighting that no other nation has sacrificed lives for its language. Beyond mere celebration, he believes TV channels have a social responsibility to produce meaningful dramas with compelling narratives for the occasion.
Tariq also expressed disappointment over the repeated re-airing of old productions, calling it a painful experience for artists. Criticising television stations, he believes that channels are increasingly prioritising commercial gains over artistic integrity, urging them to move beyond viewership-driven decisions and commit to producing at least a few high-quality dramas centred on significant national days.
Similarly, veteran actress Dilara Zaman, who has witnessed both the Language Movement and the Liberation War, stressed the importance of occasion-based productions. Despite the rise of entertainment platforms, she finds the decline in such dramas deeply disheartening. She believes dramas play a crucial role in fostering emotional connections and awareness about national days, particularly among younger generations.
The declining enthusiasm for Language Day dramas is also evident among viewers. University student Mamunur Rahman Hridoy recalled eagerly waiting for special TV dramas in the past. However, he now feels that the excitement surrounding such productions has faded, drowned out by mobile entertainment and the internet.
He noted that dramas based on the Language Movement, once a staple of his childhood, have become rare. ‚ÄúIt feels like something important has been lost. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I watched an emotionally stirring drama,‚Äù he added.

 Singer Shakira hospitalised in Peru with stomach issue ,"
                        
                        
                        Pop star Shakira has been hospitalised in Peru with a stomach issue, forcing her to cancel her Sunday show in the Andean country, the singer said on social media.
""I'm sorry to let you all know that last night I had to go to the emergency room for an abdominal issue and I'm currently hospitalized,"" Shakira wrote in her post. ""The doctors taking care of me have let me know that I'm not well enough to perform tonight.""
The Colombian singer arrived in Lima on Saturday, her first stop to perform there in more than a decade. Videos posted to her account showed hundreds of fans greeting her at the airport.
""I hope to be better by tomorrow and that they release me from the hospital as soon as possible to be able to put on the show that I've prepared for you all,"" Shakira said in her post.
Shakira, known in the Spanish-speaking world for hits such as ""La Tortura"" with Spaniard Alejandro Sanz or her 2023 diss track against ex-partner Gerard Pique, produced by Argentine DJ Bizarrap, is credited as a forerunner for Latin artists crossing over into the English-speaking market.
Her most popular song to date is ""Hips Don't Lie,"" with Wyclef Jean, featuring Shakira's now-hallmark gyrating dance moves.
The singer's next show in Lima is slated for Monday. She kicked off her tour last week in Brazil.

                        Papal selection thriller ""Conclave"" and period drama ""The Brutalist"" were the big winners at the BAFTA Film Awards on Sunday, winning four prizes each.
""Conclave"", which had led nominations with 12 nods, won the night's most coveted award, best film, as well as outstanding British film, best adapted screenplay and best editing.
""We live in a time of a crisis of democracy and institutions that are usually used to bring us together are used to pull us apart,"" ""Conclave"" director Edward Berger said in his acceptance speech for the outstanding British film award.
""And sometimes it's hard to keep the faith in that situation but that's why we make movies and that's why we made this movie.""

""This film is really about this pursuit of leaving something meaningful and I think that is something we can all relate to,"" Brody said in his acceptance speech.
""The Brutalist"" also won original score and cinematography.
In one of the big surprises of the night, Mikey Madison won the leading actress category for portraying an exotic dancer who gets involved with a Russian oligarch's son in ""Anora"".
Many had considered the frontrunners to be Demi Moore, who has received multiple honours for her performance in body horror ""The Substance"", and Briton Marianne Jean-Baptiste, for her critically acclaimed portrayal of a woman struggling with depression in ""Hard Truths"".
""I really wasn't expecting this,"" Madison said.
""I want to take to a moment to recognise the sex worker community ... you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be your friend.""
""Anora"", considered a strong awards season contender after it and director Sean Baker triumphed at the Critics Choice Awards, as well as the Producers and Directors Guild of America Awards ahead of next month's Academy Awards, was also up for best film, as was Bob Dylan biopic ""A Complete Unknown"".

SALDANA, CULKIN WIN
Fellow best film nominee ""Emilia Perez"", which mixes the diverse genres of musical and crime, triumphed in the film not in the English language category.

He thanked the film's cast members, including an absent Karla Sofia Gascon, who had been nominated for leading actress.
Zoe Saldana won supporting actress for her portrayal of a lawyer who helps a Mexican cartel leader, played by Gascon, fake his death and transition from a man to a woman.
""Emilia Perez"", had been an early awards frontrunner but its campaign lost steam following controversy surrounding Gascon, who has apologised for past social media posts denigrating Muslims and other groups and said she would go silent to help the movie ahead of the Oscars.
In the supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin won for dramedy ""A Real Pain"". The movie also picked up best original screenplay for writer-director Jesse Eisenberg.

 Timothee Chalamet channels Bob Dylan with warning about cult-like figures ,"
                        
                        
                        Timothee Chalamet learnt from his roles as Bob Dylan in ""A Complete Unknown"" and Paul Atreides in ""Dune"" that cult-like figures should be approached with caution, the Oscar-nominated actor said at the Berlin Film Festival on Friday.

""It's in the nature of his music, the warnings against cult-like figures,"" Chalamet told journalists when asked what he learnt from the US singer-songwriter about how to deal with the current state of the world.

""My interpretation is just be wary of any saviour-like figures,"" said Chalamet, whose Dylan biopic was being shown in the festival's non-competition Special section.

""That's honestly the warning in Frank Herbert's 'Dune', which was written in the same period in American history,"" added Chalamet.

""Granted, Frank Herbert was on the West Coast, probably doing acid at a typewriter, and Bob Dylan was on the East Coast, but the messaging was still similar,"" Chalamet said.

The 29-year-old actor starred in both parts of Denis Villeneuve's science-fiction epic ""Dune"", based on author Herbert's highly acclaimed 1965 novel of the same name.

Chalamet, a frontrunner in the race for best actor at next month's Oscars for his turn as Dylan, said he was grateful for his chance to play the artist.

""A Complete Unknown"", which also stars Edward Norton, Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro, chronicles Dylan's arrival in New York in 1961, his rapid ascent in folk music circles, and his divisive turn to electric rock music in 1965.

""We (the cast) know these projects are few and far between now,"" he said.

""I was looking at the Berlinale film programme, you guys have a lot of really intellectually driven, artistically driven projects, but I guess we do in the States too, but ... these things are harder to come by.""

                        Hollywood stars descend on London on Sunday for the BAFTAs, Britain's top movie honours, where the papal thriller ""Conclave"" and period drama ""The Brutalist"" look set to face competition from ""Anora"", which is emerging as an awards season favourite.

""Conclave"" leads the nominations for the awards, with 12 nods, while ""The Brutalist"", a three-and-a-half hour tale about a Hungarian immigrant trying to rebuild his life in the United States post-World War Two, leads the betting to win best film.

But many now consider ""Anora"", about an exotic dancer who gets involved with a Russian oligarch's son, a strong contender after it and director Sean Baker triumphed at the Critics Choice Awards, as well as the Producers and Directors Guild of America Awards ahead of next month's Academy Awards.

""Everyone just assumed 'The Brutalist' ... was going to win everywhere but ... (now) it feels like the momentum is behind 'Anora' and in awards season, it's all about momentum,"" Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell told Reuters.

Completing the best film list are Bob Dylan biopic ""A Complete Unknown"" and Spanish-language musical crime movie ""Emilia Perez"".

""There's certainly no frontrunner this year like there has been (before) and it's also been moving around a lot,"" Tim Richards, founder and CEO of cinema operator Vue, said.

""I actually think that ‚ÄòThe Brutalist‚Äô will most likely win best film but it's a hard call between ...‚ÄòThe Brutalist‚Äô and ‚ÄòConclave‚Äô.""

Many pundits consider the best director race to be between Baker; Edward Berger, for ""Conclave"", who made history at the 2023 awards when his German remake of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" won seven prizes; and Brady Corbet for ""The Brutalist"".

Its star Adrien Brody is favourite to win leading actor after picking awards elsewhere.

For leading actress, the frontrunners are Demi Moore, who has been repeatedly honoured for her performance in body horror ""The Substance"", and Briton Marianne Jean-Baptiste for her critically acclaimed portrayal of a woman struggling with depression in ""Hard Truths"".

""Emilia Perez"", which stars Zoe Saldana as a lawyer who helps a Mexican cartel leader, played by Karla Sofia Gascon, fake his death and transition from a man to a woman, follows ""Conclave"" with 11 nominations.

It had been an early awards frontrunner but its campaign lost steam following controversy surrounding Gascon, who has apologised for past social media posts denigrating Muslims and other groups and said she would go silent to help the movie ahead of the Oscars.

Both Gascon and Saldana are nominated in the leading and supporting actress categories respectively, and the latter is widely expected to win after her triumphs at other awards ceremonies. Gascon is not expected at the BAFTAs.

Another anticipated winner is Kieran Culkin for his supporting role in dramedy ""A Real Pain"".

""He's been winning everywhere ever since this awards race has started,"" Sandwell said. ""So for anyone but him to win would be a massive surprise.""

                        An anonymous woman who accused Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of raping her in 2000 when she was 13 dismissed her civil lawsuit on Friday against the hip-hop moguls.

 

A filing in federal court in Manhattan said the plaintiff, referred to as Jane Doe, voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning she cannot bring it again.

 

Tony Buzbee, a lawyer for the woman, declined to comment.

 

Combs is in a Brooklyn jail awaiting a scheduled May 5 criminal trial on racketeering and sex trafficking charges.

 

He still faces dozens of other civil lawsuits by women and men, including many represented by Buzbee's firm, who accused him of sexual assault and other misconduct.

 

Combs has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case, and maintained his innocence in all of the cases.

 

The Doe lawsuit was the only one to name Carter as a defendant, and he had vociferously denied the woman's claims.

 

""Today is a victory,"" Carter said in a statement posted online by his entertainment company Roc Nation. ""The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed. This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere.""

 

Carter said the case also caused trauma for his wife Beyonce, and their children.

 

In a joint statement, Combs' lawyers maintained that their client has never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone.

 

""We will continue to fight these baseless claims and hold those responsible,"" the lawyers said. ""This is just the first of many that will not hold up in a court of law.""

 

Doe accused Carter and Combs of raping her at an afterparty following the 2000 MTV Music Video Awards.

 

She said the alleged incident caused depression that led to post-traumatic stress disorder and her being ""largely withdrawn from society.""

 Oscar winner Bong Joon Ho returns to big screen with 'Mickey 17' ,"
                        
                        
                        South Korean director Bong Joon Ho premiered his highly anticipated sci-fi dark comedy, ""Mickey 17"", in London on Thursday, his first movie since the Oscar-winning ""Parasite"".

Based on the novel ""Mickey 17"" by Edward Ashton, the film stars Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes, a former pastry chef who finds himself in the unusual predicament of having to die for a living. As a so-called ""expendable"" on a mission to colonise a distant planet, Mickey is required to die and come back to life, each time as a new version of himself.

""The film asks the question of we are all humans but how do we live a more human life,"" Bong told Reuters via a translator.

""This guy is someone who is too nice for his own good, just unfortunate things happen to him and in the film he somehow manages to find his own journey of reclaiming his selfhood and I think in that process a lot people who also have quite extreme jobs might find comfort in Mickey's journey.""

Bong made history at the 2020 Oscars when ""Parasite,"" a dark social satire about the gap between rich and poor in modern Seoul, became the first non-English language film to win the best picture award, the movie industry's highest honour. It won a total of four Oscars, including best director and original screenplay for Bong.

Asked what pressure he felt in making his next film, Bong said: ""I was already in my 50s (when) I won the Oscars and I tend not to get excited as a person. I just maintained my calm and did the same thing and it was the same for this film.""

In the film, Mickey's suicidal missions include being exposed to a deadly virus and a colony of part-insect, part-mammal creatures.

""Sci-fi scripts normally ... follow a certain pattern and with this, I was like 'What is happening?' every page,"" Pattinson said. ""Bong has such unique take on reality and story-telling, it just felt very exciting.""

""Mickey 17"", which also stars Toni Collette, Naomi Ackie, Mark Ruffalo and Steven Yeun, begins its cinema rollout on Feb 28 in South Korea, and other countries from Mar 5.

                        Warner Bros has agreed to develop a ""Harry Potter Studio Tour"" in Shanghai with Jinjiang International, the Chinese group said on Wednesday.
Jinjiang said in a social media post that the proposed amusement park would give visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the Harry Potter films and recreate well-known scenes. It will cover an area of over 53,000 square meters.
The project will be part of a large-scale renovation of a Shanghai theme park that Jinjiang operates and is due to open in 2027. The plans are still subject to regulatory approval.
It would mark Warner Bros' third ""Harry Potter Studio Tour"" worldwide after sites in London and Tokyo.
The Harry Potter franchise is incredibly popular in China, a country where foreign films make up a relatively small percentage of the country's total box office due to strict quotas and a shift to local content.
A Universal Studios theme park in Beijing features ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter"", a section dedicated to Harry Potter-themed rides and attractions. The eight Harry Potter films were also re-released in Chinese cinemas last year.

                        A street performance by Ed Sheeran in India's tech capital of Bengaluru was stopped abruptly by police on Sunday, outraging fans and prompting the British singer to issue a clarification.

Sheeran, dressed in a white t-shirt and shorts, was seen singing and playing his guitar on a pavement in the centre of Bengaluru ahead of his concert on Sunday night.

Local channels showed a policeman walking up to Sheeran as he was singing the hit single ""Shape of You"" and unplugging the microphone, as onlookers jeered. Sheeran left soon after.

Police said event organisers had refused permission for the street performance, which was on one of the city's busiest streets.

""I refused to give permission because Church Street gets very crowded. That is the reason he was asked to vacate the place,"" Bengaluru police official Shekar T Tekkannanavar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

Sheeran, who began his career as a busker in the UK, said later on his Instagram account that he did have permission to perform.

""It wasn't just us randomly turning up. All good though,"" he wrote.

Sheeran is in India for a series of concerts, and performed in front of thousands of people at an open ground in the city later that night, accompanied by Indian singer Shilpa Rao.

Lamar, fresh off winning five Grammys including song and record of the year for his ubiquitous diss track ""Not Like Us"" on Sunday, is currently at the zenith of his powers but said he has never forgotten where he came from.

""I've always had a form of that. So I like that sense of, make people listen, but also see and think a little.""

Lamar was raised in poverty in the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Compton but found inspiration in the ""hard raps"" and ""good beats"" being produced by west coast artists like Tupac Shakur.

Performing at the Super Bowl halftime show, one of the most-watched music events of the year, never crossed his mind when he was making his way to the top.

""I wasn't thinking about no Super Bowl, for sure,"" he said with a laugh.

""We were thinking about the best verse and how we are going to split this $5 at Church's Chicken or something like that.""

But some things have not changed for the artist, who has 22 Grammy Awards and took home a Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2018 for his narrative-rich album DAMN.

""What I know is the passion I have now is still the passion I had then,"" he said.

Lamar was tight-lipped when asked by the interviewers from Apple Music about what songs he will select from his vast catalogue to fill the 13-minute performance window, although he hinted that may lean more on his most recent material.

""Only 13 minutes. It's kind of wild because it lets you know where you're at, your perspective about how you think about the catalogue and the music,"" he said.

""For me, I love being present and it's very hard for me to live in the past.

""I respect the past but being in the now and being locked in to how I feel now, that's the LA energy for me. That's something I want to carry over to New Orleans for the world to see.

""This is me, Kendrick Lamar, 37 years old and I still feel like I'm elevating, still on a journey, and I want that energy to ooze out of the television and to the people that are in that building.""

It was previously revealed that his collaborator, R&B singer SZA, would perform alongside him on the stage at the Superdome.

""For me personally, watching her career and where she's come from, it's amazing to see,"" he said.

""I'm just honoured to be next to her talent.""

The superstar singer triumphed over Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and others to claim the trophy that had eluded her even as she collected more lifetime Grammys than any other artist.

""I just feel very full and very honored. It's been many, many years,"" Beyonce said on stage on Sunday.

Rapper Kendrick Lamar claimed record of the year and song of the year for ""Not Like Us,"" a diss track in his feud with Canadian rapper and singer Drake.

""Pink Pony Club"" singer Chappell Roan was named best new artist and used her time on stage to urge record labels to pay musicians a living wage with healthcare benefits. She recalled a time when she felt ""dehumanized"" to not have health insurance.""Labels - we got you, but do you got us?"" she said.

This year's Grammy festivities were revamped to be part awards show and part fundraiser for people affected by the wildfires, which were contained on Friday after killing 29 people and displacing thousands including many musicians.

                        The Grammy Awards take center stage in Los Angeles on Sunday at a celebration that will honour the best of music while acknowledging the deadly wildfires that scarred a hub of the industry.

Beyonce will compete for the top Grammy prize of album of the year with her country record ""Cowboy Carter."" The superstar singer has never won the album trophy despite winning 32 career Grammys, more than any other musician.

Also in the running for album of the year are megastar Taylor Swift for ""The Tortured Poets Department"" and Billie Eilish for ""Hit Me Hard and Soft.""

The ceremony will be broadcast live on CBS starting at 8pm ET (0100 GMT on Monday) from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles. Comedian Trevor Noah returns to host the telecast, which will be part awards show, part fundraiser for musicians and others impacted by the recent fires. Hundreds of people in the music business were among those who lost homes in the disaster.

""It will be a little tricky to pull off, but I'm starting to think they're going to be able to do it,"" said Paul Grein, awards editor at music publication Billboard. With the fires under control, ""people can take a breather and express gratitude and relief that we made it through that.""

Eilish and best new artist nominees Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are among the night's scheduled performers. The show will feature a tribute to Quincy Jones, the prolific music producer who died in November.

At last year's Grammys, Beyonce's husband and rapper Jay-Z argued that voters had not given proper recognition to Black artists including his wife. Grammy winners are chosen by the 13,000 singers, songwriters, producers, engineers and others who make up the Recording Academy.

""I don't want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than anyone and never won album of the year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn't work,"" Jay-Z said on stage.

""Cowboy Carter"" was viewed by experts and fans as a reclamation and homage to an overlooked legacy of Black Americans within country music and culture. It became the first album by a Black woman to land at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart when it was released last spring.

The Beyonce album was snubbed, however, by voters for the Country Music Awards in their nominations in September.

The ""Cowboy Carter"" nomination is Beyonce's fifth entry in the album of the year category. Swift has won the honor a record four times, including last year for ""Midnights.""

Beyonce leads all Grammy nominees this year with 11 nods, followed by Eilish, Charli XCX, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone with seven nominations each. Swift landed six nominations and will present one of the night's awards.

Beyonce's other Grammy nods include record and song of the year for single ""Texas Hold 'Em.""

Competitors for song of the year, an award for songwriters, are Eilish for ""Birds of a Feather,"" Carpenter for ""Please Please Please"" and Roan for ""Good Luck, Babe!""

In record of the year, nominees include Carpenter's ""Espresso"" and Swift's duet with Post Malone, ""Fortnight.""

                        After more than a year, legendary Bangladeshi singer Sabina Yasmin returned to the stage, only to fall ill and be rushed to the hospital.
On Friday evening, while performing at a hotel in Dhaka, she suddenly felt unwell and was taken to a nearby private hospital.
Following initial treatment, she is now in stable condition, according to her relative Jahangir Sayeed.
Around 12:15am on Saturday, Jahangir answered a call to Sabina‚Äôs phone and told bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúShe has been brought home and is now sleeping. Her condition is better.‚Äù
Sabina Yasmin had been away from the stage for over a year, spending a long time abroad for medical treatment as her cancer had relapsed.
After undergoing treatment and radiotherapy, she recovered and resumed singing.
On Jan 22, she told bdnews24.com that she would be performing at multiple events in Dhaka and Chattogram.
On Friday evening, she was performing at the event ""Our Sabina Yasmin: I Am Here to Stay‚Äù at a hotel in Banani when she suddenly collapsed on stage.
Singer Dithi Anwar told bdnews24.com, ‚ÄúShe sang continuously for about 12 songs before suddenly collapsing. She was then taken to the hospital.‚Äù
Sabina was also scheduled to perform on the same stage on Saturday, but the event has been cancelled, confirmed Dithi.
She was first diagnosed with cancer in 2007 but recovered after treatment and returned to a normal life and her music career.
Over the years, she performed not only in Bangladesh but also in the United States, Australia, and several other countries.
In February last year, news of her cancer relapse surfaced, making headlines both in Bangladesh and Indian media.
Later, in a message to the public, Sabina revealed that she was undergoing treatment in Singapore. She mentioned that on Feb 7 last year, she had a minor surgery on her tooth, followed by multiple rounds of radiotherapy for a full recovery.
Recently, she returned to Dhaka. On Jan 4, when the body of Dhaka film actress Anjana Rahman was brought to the Channel i premises, Sabina was present.

 Netflix unveils 'Squid Game' season 3 premiere date and preview footage ,"
                        
                        
                        The popular South Korean drama ""Squid Game"" will return to Netflix on June 27 for a third and final season, the streaming platform announced during its ""Next on Netflix"" event on Thursday.

The event also featured a short clip from the upcoming season, which reveals yet another tension-filled scene from within the games.

The survival thriller action series turned into a global sensation in 2021, bolstering Netflix's subscription numbers and becoming the streaming service's most-watched original series in its first month.

Netflix reported that 142 million households had watched the dark drama about people who compete in a deadly competition to erase financial debt.

The return of ""Squid Game,"" together with high-profile live events such as the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson boxing match and two National Football League games on Christmas Day, helped Netflix add a record 19 million subscribers in its fourth quarter, to bring its total global subscriber base to nearly 302 million.

The third season will be the last installment of the series, which was developed for television by Korean writer and producer Hwang Dong-hyuk. The story will once again follow Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist Seong Gi-hun, who is determined to stop the dystopian games.

""Squid Game"" is one of a trio of popular series returning to Netflix this year. The supernatural drama ""Stranger Things"" returns for a fifth and final installment, and the Addams Family-inspired series, ""Wednesday,"" is back for its second season.

""Stranger Things"" creators Matt and Ross Duffer said they shot more than 650 hours of footage for the final season, but told members of the press gathered Wednesday for Netflix's annual showcase of films, series and games that there would be more stories to tell.

""With more than 700 million people watching, we can‚Äôt just be one thing,"" Netflix Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria said. ""We need to be the best version of everything.""

Other highlights of the showcase included footage of Academy Award-winning filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro's new film, ""Frankenstein,"" which reanimates Mary Shelley's classic tale.

""This film has been on my mind since I was a child - for fifty years,"" Guillermo said in videotaped remarks. ""And I‚Äôve been trying to make it for 20 to 25 years.""

Ben Affleck touted a drama, ""RIP,"" teaming up once again with Matt Damon, this time in a crime thriller inspired by true events, set in Florida.

Stand-up comedian John Mulaney will return to Netflix on March 12 for a weekly live late-night show, ""Everybody's Live with John Mulaney,"" which will run for 12 weeks.

‚ÄúWe will be live globally with no delay. We will never be relevant. We will never be your source for news. We will always be reckless,‚Äù Mulaney said.

" Pori Moni gets bail in assault, intimidation case filed by businessman Nasir ","
                        
                        
                        Actress Shamsunnahar Smriti, known by the stage name Pori Moni, has been granted bail in a case alleging assault, vandalism, and intimidation of businessman Nasir Uddin Mahmood, director of Savar Boat Club.
Pori Moni surrendered before the court of Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Judge Mohammad Junaid on Monday and petitioned for bail. The bail was then granted.
Nilanjana Rifat Suravi, Pori Moni‚Äôs lawyer, confirmed the decision.
On Sunday, Junaid had framed charges against the actress in the case and issued an arrest warrant against her if she failed to appear.
That day, defence counsel Suravi told bdnews24.com, ‚ÄúThe hearing for framing of charges was set for today. But Pori Moni could not attend it due to illness, and we requested an adjournment.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe complainant‚Äôs side moved to proceed with the hearing. The court rejected our adjournment plea, framed charges, and cancelled Pori Moni‚Äôs bail, issuing an arrest warrant against her.‚Äù
On Mar 18, 2024, Inspector Monir Hossain of Police Bureau of Investigation, or PBI, the case‚Äôs investigation officer, submitted a probe report confirming the allegations against Pori Moni and co-accused Junaid Baghdadi Jimmy.


However, no specific charges were found against Fatema Tuz Jannat Bonny, another accused in the case.
On Apr 18, 2024, the court accepted the PBI‚Äôs investigation report and summoned Pori Moni.
She later surrendered on Jun 26 and secured bail.
Nasir filed the case with the Savar Police Station on Jul 6, 2022.
The PBI‚Äôs report said that on the evening of Jun 8, 2021, Pori Moni, with malicious intent, sought to trap the complainant, Nasir, into forming a personal connection.
She reportedly violated Boat Club rules by demanding a free parcel of three litres of Blue Label whiskey.
When denied, she allegedly threatened Nasir and threw an ashtray at him injuring him in the head.
The report also said she hurled glass bottles, ashtrays, and other items across the club bar, causing extensive damage.
Nasir suffered visible injuries, including wounds on his chest caused by shards of broken glass.
The investigation found prima facie evidence of offences under sections 323 and 506 of the Penal Code against Pori Moni.
The report also revealed that during the chaos, witness Tuhin Siddiqui intervened as Nasir urged the accused to leave the premises.
Junaid allegedly approached Nasir aggressively, verbally abused and punched him.
This supported the initial allegations under sections 323 and 506 against Junaid.
Fatema was present during the incident, but no specific evidence substantiating charges against her was found.

 'Cute and murderous': How Squid Game's iconic killer doll came to life ,"
                        
                        
                        While the second season of ""Squid Game"" has new plot twists, one element of the Netflix mega-hit series where contestants down on their luck risk their lives to play children's games for the chance of winning cash prizes, has remained constant.

That is Young-hee, an innocent-looking robotic doll who in fact has a deadly role in the South Korean-made television series to find contestants to gun down playing the game ""Red Light, Green Light"" if she spots them moving.

Young-hee, who is clad in a simple orange dress and a hair clip, has become a viral meme on social media and the centrepiece of the streaming giant's promotional campaign.

Chae Kyoung-sun, the production designer for ""Squid Game"", said the doll's appearance had been partly inspired by her own daughter.

""My daughter had a bowl cut for a long time which was very cute so I decided to draw a very short bang,"" Chae told Reuters.

""Her eyes are a little crazy. She's a killing machine and the movement of her eyes had to be easy to see, so we made her eyes quite big.""

The initial inspiration for Young-hee came from a girl of the same name on the cover of old primary school textbooks in South Korea, though the killer doll was initially conceived as genderless, Chae said.The first season of ""Squid Game"" became the most-watched show on the streaming platform and expectations were high for the second season to replicate the success.

The new season of the dystopian thriller, released on Dec. 26, also broke a record as the most-watched show in its premiere week on the streaming platform, with 68 million views, according to Netflix.The streaming giant said on Tuesday it gained a record 18.9 million subscribers in its fourth quarter thanks in part to the second season of Squid Game.

In 2023, Netflix announced a $2.5 billion investment in South Korea to produce Korean TV series, movies and unscripted shows.

Asked about the success of the show and this particular character, Chae put it down to their unorthodox nature.

""How does this cute kid suddenly turn into a killing machine? - I think the creation of the 'Squid Game' world by adopting unpredictable concepts and methods resonated with young people looking for fresh things,"" she said.

At the end of the second season, viewers also get a glimpse of Chul-su, a male doll set to appear in the next season alongside Young-hee that was originally envisaged for the first series.

""When they said there will be a second season and that Chul-su would appear, I brought back the drawings I had of Chul-su for the first season,"" Chae said.

""Think of it as a friend, a partner,"" she said.

The third and final season of Squid Game is set to be released later this year.

 Trump's big Syria announcement surprised his own sanctions officials ,"
                        
                        
                        When President Donald Trump announced in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that he would lift all sanctions on Syria, the decision - which will boost a country devastated by 13 years of war - took many in the region by surprise.

It also caught some in his own administration off guard.

In Washington, senior officials at the State Department and Treasury Department scrambled to understand how to cancel the sanctions, many of which have been in place for decades, according to four US officials familiar with the matter.

The White House had issued no memorandum or directive to State or Treasury sanctions officials to prepare for the unwinding and didn‚Äôt alert them that the president‚Äôs announcement was imminent, one senior U.S. official told Reuters.

The sudden removal of the sanctions appeared to be a classic Trump move - a sudden decision, a dramatic announcement and a shock not just for allies but also some of the very officials who implement the policy change.

After the announcement, officials were confused about exactly how the administration would unwind the layers of sanctions, which ones were being eased and when the White House wanted to begin the process.

By the time Trump met interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, officials at State and Treasury were still unsure how to proceed, the senior official said.

‚ÄúEveryone is trying to figure out how to implement it,‚Äù said one US official in reference to the president‚Äôs announcement.

Following the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad late last year, officials from both State and Treasury had drafted memos and options papers to help guide the government on lifting Syria sanctions if and when the administration chose to do so.

But senior White House and national security officials, as well as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, have for months debated whether to ease sanctions, given Sharaa's former ties with al Qaeda. The Syrian leader severed ties with the group in 2016.

Before Trump‚Äôs trip to Saudi Arabia, there was no clear indication ‚Äì at least to the officials inside State and Treasury working on sanctions ‚Äì that the president had made a decision, the senior U.S. official said.

The State Department and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A White House official told Reuters that Turkey and Saudi Arabia had asked Trump to lift the sanctions and to meet with Sharaa. In his announcement, Trump said that he did so to give Syria a chance at a better future.

COMPLICATED UNWINDING

The easing of sanctions on Syria does not appear to be imminent.

A White House readout of Trump's meeting with the Syrian leader said the president asked Syria to adhere to several conditions in exchange for sanctions relief, including telling all foreign terrorists to leave Syria, deporting ""Palestinian terrorists,"" and helping the U.S. prevent the resurgence of ISIS.

Removing sanctions is rarely straightforward, often requiring close coordination between multiple different agencies and Congress.

But it is particularly challenging in Syria's case, given the layers of measures cutting it off from the international banking system and barring many international imports.

The US first put the country on its state sponsor of terror list in 1979 and since then has added additional sets of sanctions, including several rounds following the country‚Äôs 2011 uprising against Assad.

Edward Fishman, a former US official and the author of the book ""Chokepoints,"" said the unwinding of Syria sanctions, which were imposed under a mix of executive orders and statutes, could take months to ease. He noted, however, that the Treasury Department has practice from sanctions relief provided to Iran as part of the nuclear deal in 2015.

Complicating the task are sanctions imposed under the ""Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act,"" also known as the ""Caesar Act,‚Äù which was passed in 2019 and extended late last year just after Syria's government fell. The act imposed stiff sanctions not just on Assad's government but also secondary sanctions on outside companies or governments that worked with it.

Overturning the bill would require congressional action, but it includes a provision allowing the president to suspend the sanctions for national security reasons. Trump could also issue a general license suspending some or all of the sanctions.

Fishman said he would be surprised if every single sanction was lifted as part of Trump's order, adding that some specific people or entities in Syria sanctioned for specific behavior-based reasons, such as support for a terrorist group, may not be removed from the sanctions list.

 Harvard University puts up $250 million to shore up research hit by Trump freeze on grants ,"
                        
                        
                        Harvard University is dedicating $250 million of its own funds to support researchers after US President Donald Trump's administration froze nearly $3 billion in federal grants and contracts in recent weeks, the university announced on Wednesday.

The elite Ivy League university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of Trump's most prominent targets. The Republican president has been making an extraordinary effort to revamp private colleges and schools across the US that he says foster anti-American, Marxist and ""radical left"" ideologies. He has criticised Harvard in particular for hiring prominent Democrats to teaching or leadership positions.

Harvard is suing the Trump administration over its decision to cut off grants awarded to the school's researchers, mostly in the medical sciences. Harvard calls this an unconstitutional attempt to curtail academic freedom and speech rights.

The government announced the cuts last month, hours after Harvard's president, Dr Alan Garber, denounced a lengthy list of demands by the Trump administration to overhaul the school's leadership, teaching and admissions, and audit the views of its students and professors.

Garber, in a joint statement with Provost John Manning, said the Trump administration was ""stopping lifesaving research"" and called it an ""extraordinarily challenging time"" for the country's oldest and wealthiest university.

On Wednesday, Harvard said Garber was taking a temporary, voluntary pay cut of 25% starting in July. The university previously announced a hiring freeze.

The statement said Harvard ""cannot absorb the entire cost"" of the frozen grants, which the Trump administration says are worth more than $2.6 billion. The school said it was working with researchers to help them find alternative funding.

""The impact of such steps on the nation's scientific research enterprise could be severe and lasting,"" the statement said.

Trump's administration has accused Harvard of continuing to consider race when reviewing student applications and of allowing discrimination against Jews as a result of the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled American campuses last year.

Harvard says its admissions practices comply with federal law and court rulings, and it continues to combat antisemitism and other prejudice on its campuses.

A federal judge in Boston has given the government until June 9 to respond to Harvard's lawsuit, and has scheduled a hearing for July 21.

 US-backed aid group to start work in Gaza by end of May under heavily criticised plan ,"
                        
                        
                        A US-backed humanitarian organization will start work in Gaza by the end of May under a heavily-criticised aid distribution plan, but has asked Israel to let the United Nations and others resume deliveries to Palestinians now until it is set up.

No humanitarian assistance has been delivered to Gaza since March 2, and a global hunger monitor has warned that half a million people face starvation - a quarter of the population in the enclave where Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas have been at war since October 2023.

Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies, and is blocking humanitarian deliveries to Gaza until Hamas releases all remaining hostages. Israel has said it backs ""the American humanitarian plan.""

That plan was initiated by Israel and involves private companies - instead of the UN and aid groups - transporting aid into Gaza to a limited number of so-called secure distribution sites, which Israel said would be in Gaza's south.

The newly created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will run the operation. US security firm UG Solutions and US-based Safe Reach Solutions, which does logistics and planning, would be involved, said a source familiar with the plans, speaking on condition of anonymity.

At the distribution sites, the humanitarian assistance would be given to aid groups to give to civilians, the source said.

CONCERNS

Washington has urged the UN and aid groups to cooperate with the GHF. However, they raised concerns that the operation would not stick to the long-held humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.

""We have made clear our problems with the sort of aid mechanism that's been proposed,"" deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said earlier on Wednesday, citing heavy criticism of the proposed operation by UN aid chief Tom Fletcher.

In a letter to Israel on Wednesday, the foundation's executive director, Jake Wood, sought to address some of the concerns. He said the foundation would not share any personally identifiable information of aid recipients with Israel.

In a separate statement, GHF said Israel has agreed to expand the number of distribution sites ""to serve the entire population of Gaza, and to find solutions for the distribution of aid to civilians who are unable to reach a SDS location.""

Israel's mission to the UN declined to comment.

In his letter, Wood asked Israel's military to ""identify and deconflict sufficient locations in northern Gaza capable of hosting GHF operated secure distribution sites that can be made operational within thirty days.""

He also asked Israel to facilitate the flow of enough aid ""using existing modalities"" now until GHF's infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to ""alleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure, as well as decrease the pressure on the distribution sites during our first days of operation.""

Following the GHF announcement, the International Committee of the Red Cross said concerns about the plan remained.

                        The Indian Army said at least 10 militants were killed in an operation still underway in the troubled northeastern state of Manipur, bordering Myanmar.

The deaths came months after Reuters reported in November that Indian militant groups that sought refuge in Myanmar and fought in its civil war had begun streaming back across the border to Manipur.

" Republicans push ahead on Trump tax, spending plans, despite intra-party dissent ","
                        
                        
                        Republicans in the US Congress advanced major elements of President Donald Trump's budget package on Wednesday, as key committees approved tax cuts that would add trillions of dollars to the US debt, while cutting spending on healthcare for the poor and disabled.

With Democrats boycotting this top priority of Trump's, Republicans relied on their majorities in the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce panel overseeing Medicaid and other healthcare programs to advance the controversial package of bills.

Flexing their majority muscles, Republicans defeated all of the Democrats' amendments to the Republican-written bill.

It amounts to an initial victory for Republicans, who still have many hurdles to clear before they can get the sprawling package of tax cuts, spending hikes and safety-net reductions to Trump's desk to sign into law.

Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" would add trillions of dollars to the nation's debt load, which at $36.2 trillion now equals 127% of GDP. The package calls for $4 trillion in additional borrowing, though the total cost is uncertain at this point.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, told reporters his party was on track to pass the massive legislation before the May 26 Memorial Day holiday. But he still faced dissent from within his own party.

Moderate Republican lawmakers from Democratic-led coastal states including New York, New Jersey and California -- critical to the party's narrow 220-213 majority -- say the bill imposes too low a limit on how much state and local taxes can be deducted from constituents' federal income taxes.

""As this stands right now, I am a 'no,' and so they're going to need to come up with a solution here and quickly if they want to stay on the schedule,"" said Republican Representative Mike Lawler of New York and an advocate of the so-called SALT deduction.

Party hardliners, meanwhile, are demanding deeper spending cuts.

""I'm trying to get the math in order to get this country back on track, financially. And it just hasn't happened,‚Äù said hardline Republican Ralph Norman of South Carolina.

Following a work-session that spanned more than 26 hours, the Energy and Commerce Committee voted along party lines on Republicans' plan to tighten eligibility for the Medicaid health plan, which covers 71 million low-income Americans.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD, DRUG FOCUS

The Energy and Commerce panel spent much of Wednesday debating abortion, prescription drug prices and healthcare costs.

Democrats failed in an attempt to remove a provision from the legislation prohibiting Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider mainly for low-income women that provides abortion services in states where it is legal.

Federal funding for abortions already is not allowed and Democratic Representative Lizzie Fletcher of Texas argued that the bill would stop Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood even in states where abortion is illegal and its doctors are providing essential services, such as cancer screenings and pregnancy visits.

Representative Frank Pallone, the senior Democrat on the committee, criticized Republicans for crafting healthcare policy with just cost-savings in mind in order to finance tax cuts for the wealthy -- instead of basing changes on sound health policy.

""Why are we just talking about numbers, how much we're going to save to pay for these tax cuts,"" Pallone asked.

Republican Representative Buddy Carter argued that the changes to Medicaid would not harm those who legitimately qualify for benefits. ""We are trying to stabilize this, to secure it, to save it,"" he said.

The committee's Medicaid plan would save the federal government $715 billion and kick 7.7 million people off the program, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

A third panel continued working on agriculture and nutrition issues, including a proposal to require some people who receive SNAP food benefits to get a job and shift some costs to states.

It would extend tax cuts passed in Trump's first term that are due to expire at the end of the year, and add new tax breaks for workers, retirees and private schools. To offset some of the cost, the package would cancel green-energy programs passed under Democratic President Joe Biden.

The country's looming debt ceiling deadline this summer is also pushing Republicans to work fast. The package would raise the debt limit by $4 trillion and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged lawmakers to act by mid-July to avoid a default that would upend the global economy.

" Putin, Trump to skip Ukraine's peace talks that Russian leader proposed ","
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will not attend what could be the first direct peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv in three years on Thursday, the Kremlin sending instead a group of experienced technocrats.

Putin on Sunday proposed direct negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday ""without any preconditions"". Late on Wednesday, the Kremlin said the delegation would include presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky and Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin.

After the Kremlin's delegation announcement, a US official said Trump would not attend - days after saying that he was considering the trip.

While Putin had never confirmed he would attend in person, the absence of the Russian and US presidents lowers the expectations for a major breakthrough in the war that Russia started in February 2022.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had challenged the Kremlin leader to attend the talks ""if he's not afraid,"" in an apparent contest to show Trump who wants peace more. Zelensky was on his way to Turkey, a Ukrainian official said. Earlier, the Kyiv leader has said he would take part in the negotiations only if Putin were there.

Trump wants the two sides to sign up to a 30-day ceasefire to pause Europe's biggest land war since World War Two, and a Russian lawmaker said on Wednesday there could also be discussions about a huge prisoner of war exchange.

Zelensky backs an immediate 30-day ceasefire, but Putin has said he first wants to start talks at which the details of such a ceasefire could be discussed.

MORE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA?

Trump, who is growing increasingly frustrated with both Russia and Ukraine as he tries to push them towards a peace settlement, said he was ""always considering"" secondary sanctions against Moscow if he thought it was blocking the process.

US officials have spoken about possible financial sanctions as well as potential secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian oil.

A Ukrainian diplomatic source told Reuters on Wednesday that Ukraine's leadership would decide on its next steps for peace talks in Turkey once there was clarity on Putin's participation.

The US delegation to Turkey included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and senior envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said early on Thursday he had met with Rubio to share Zelensky's peace vision and ""coordinate positions during this critical week.""

Medinsky and Fomin, part of the Russian delegation, took part in the last set of negotiations between the two sides in the first weeks of the war.

Direct talks between negotiators from Ukraine and Russia last took place in Istanbul in March 2022, a month after Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in what he calls a ""special military operation"" to root out neo-Nazis.

" Bypassed by Trump, Israel dismayed but silent ","
                        
                        
                        Israel's right-wing government has maintained a diplomatic silence this week as US President Donald Trump fired off a blizzard of announcements that have shaken Israeli assumptions about their country's standing with its most important ally.

Trump's decision to bypass Israel during his current visit to the Middle East had already been seen as a marker of the his administration's increased focus on lucrative business deals with wealthy Gulf countries, including Qatar, which Israeli officials have long accused of helping Hamas.

Even before the trip began, Israel was on edge over US talks with its arch-enemy Iran and over Trump's decision to stop bombing the Houthis in Yemen, regardless of the Iranian-backed group's determination to keep up its own missile strikes against Israel.

Israeli officials were then forced to stand by and watch as the United States negotiated to reach a deal with the Palestinian militant group Hamas to bring home Edan Alexander, the last surviving American hostage in Gaza.

Since then, they have had to listen as Trump declared an end to sanctions on Syria and called for a normalization of relations with the new government in Damascus, which Israel regards as a barely disguised jihadist regime.

Even as Trump spoke in Riyadh on Tuesday, claiming credit for the ceasefire agreement with the Houthis, Israeli media noted that warning sirens were sounding in areas across Israel including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as a missile from Yemen headed towards them.

Trump himself has brushed off any suggestion of a break with Israel, telling reporters accompanying him in the Gulf that his visit would ultimately benefit a country that has so far viewed him as one of its staunchest supporters.

""This is good for Israel, having a relationship like I have with these countries; Middle Eastern countries, essentially all of them,"" he said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far made no comment, beyond thanking Trump for helping with the release of Alexander.

But he has faced widespread public perception that Israel, already under international pressure over the Gaza war, which has stymied its own hopes of normalising relations with Saudi Arabia, has been left behind.

""The Middle East is in the process of being reshaped in front of our very eyes through a series of agreements and meetings, while Israel has remained (in the best-case scenario) an observer on the sidelines,"" wrote Yoav Limor, a commentator in the right-leaning Israel Hayom newspaper.

DIVERGING PRIORITIES

Netanyahu, currently on trial on corruption charges which he denies, made no secret of his preference for Trump over the previous White House incumbent Joe Biden, who held back some heavy munitions deliveries and imposed sanctions on a number of violent Israeli settlers.

He faces pressure both from religious-nationalist hardliners in his government, who have insisted on continuing the war in Gaza until the final defeat of Hamas, and an Israeli public increasingly tired of a conflict that has lasted for more than 18 months. So far, he has sided with the hardliners.

But the events of the past two weeks suggest there was a ""clear divergence of priorities"" and the special treatment from US administrations that has normally been enjoyed by Israel may not apply, said Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy US national intelligence officer for the Middle East.

""Trump is clearly determined to move ahead with a transactional, trade and investment focused agenda,"" said Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington.

""If the traditional political or security matters that the US and Israel have always historically coordinated on closely don't align well with Trump's priorities, he's going to go forward with them anyways.""

While insisting that US-Israeli relations remain strong, Trump administration officials at times have privately expressed frustration with Netanyahu as the president seeks to fulfil his campaign promise to quickly end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

They want Netanyahu to work harder to reach a ceasefire and hostages deal with Hamas and have also shown little appetite for backing any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities while the US pursues a diplomatic solution.

White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said the administration was continuing to work with Israel to free the remaining 58 hostages held in Gaza and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East.

""Israel has had no better friend in its history than President Trump,"" he said.

The hardliners in the Israeli government, who once rejoiced at Trump's announcement of a plan to clear Gaza of its Palestinian population and develop the coastal enclave into a beachside resort, have been largely silent and Israeli officials have been careful to avoid any criticism of the US administration.

""The United States is a sovereign country,"" a foreign ministry spokesperson said this week, when asked if there was concern that Israel had been sidelined over the release of Alexander. Israel's ""intimate dialogue"" with the United States would be conducted ""directly and not through the media.""

An Israeli team has been dispatched to Doha to join ceasefire talks coordinated by Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, but Israeli forces have stepped up strikes in Gaza, killing dozens of Palestinians on Wednesday.

Netanyahu himself signalled Israel, which earlier this month announced plans for an intensified campaign in Gaza, was sticking to its war aims, including dismantling Hamas as a military and governing power.

""Israel will not stop and will not surrender,"" he said on Wednesday.

                        Al Qaeda affiliate JNIM has claimed responsibility for an attack targeting a military post in Burkina Faso's northern Loroum province in which the group said 60 soldiers were killed, the SITE Intelligence Group said on Tuesday.

The U.S.-based non-governmental organization, which tracks online activity of Islamist militants, said JNIM had posted messages on Monday and Tuesday in which it took credit for four assaults in Burkina Faso and Mali.

The attacks highlight the difficulties the three Sahel nations of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, ruled by military leaders, are facing in containing the insurgents.

Burkina authorities have not commented on the latest attacks.

The most notable attack occurred in the Burkina town of Sole, where JNIM fighters raided the army military post and killed soldiers, SITE Intelligence said, without specifying on which day it took place.

Another Burkina attack killed 10 members of a pro-government militia known as VDP in eastern Gnagna province, SITE added.

In a separate statement, SITE said Ousmane Dicko, head of Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JMIN) in Burkina, had appeared in a video urging residents of Djibo, located in the north of Burkina Faso, to leave the town for their own safety.

An army base in Djibo came under attack on Sunday morning, and a police station and market were also targeted, security sources told Reuters.

Three Djibo residents described an intense assault involving hundreds of fighters on facilities housing soldiers and pro-government militiamen. Although there was no official toll, the witnesses said dozens of soldiers and civilians were killed.

""The population saw soldiers burnt in the flames of explosions. Multiple military arsenals were taken and civilians were killed by gunfire,"" a teacher in Djibo, told Reuters.

Israel invaded Gaza after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israeli communities on October 7, 2023, and has recently announced plans for an expanded offensive to defeat militant group Hamas.

""Over the past months I have spoken with Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu on several occasions, and the conversations have often been difficult,"" Meloni told a question time session in the Italian lower house of parliament.

More than 52,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive, according to local health authorities. The military campaign has left Gaza on the brink of famine, aid groups and international agencies say.

""I have always recalled the urgency of finding a way to end the hostilities and respect international law and international humanitarian law. A request that I renew today,"" Meloni said.

Israeli strikes intensified this week, killing dozens in northern Gaza, locals have said.

French President Emmanuel Macron this week also criticised Netanyahu's policy in Gaza, calling it shameful. The Israeli leader struck back accusing Macron of siding with Hamas.

Meloni's government has been one of Israel's most vocal supporters within Europe, but there has been growing unease within parts of her coalition over Israel's relentless and long-running military campaign.

TRUMP VISIT

Palestinians hope Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates will provide pressure for a reduction of violence. Hamas on Monday released Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage it had been holding.

Trump said in Riyadh on Tuesday that more hostages would follow Alexander and that the people of Gaza deserved a better future. He is not visiting Israel during his Middle East trip.

Ceasefire efforts have faltered. Hamas talked to the United States and Egyptian and Qatari mediators to arrange Alexander's release, and Israel has sent a team to Doha to begin a new round of talks.

On Tuesday, Trump's special envoys Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler met hostage families in Tel Aviv and said they saw a better chance of an agreement for the hostages' release following the deal over Alexander.

Hamas said on Wednesday the continued attacks indicated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to ""escalate the aggression and massacres against civilians to undermine those (ceasefire) efforts"". Israel has blamed Hamas for the continuing war.

The US has presented a plan to reopen humanitarian aid deliveries in Gaza using private contractors. Israel, which imposed a total blockade of supplies going into Gaza from March 2, has endorsed the plan but it has been rejected by the United Nations and international aid agencies.

Israel invaded Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led attack on southern Israeli communities on October 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken as hostages to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,900 Palestinians, according to local health officials. It has left Gaza on the brink of famine, aid groups and international agencies say.

 Syrian leader Sharaa's path from global jihad to meeting Trump ,"
                        
                        
                        Syria's Ahmed al-Sharaa has transformed himself from al Qaeda militant to Syrian president in a dramatic political rise capped on Wednesday by a meeting with US President Donald Trump.

The encounter in Saudi Arabia is a milestone for a man who joined al Qaeda in Iraq around the time of the 2003 US-led invasion and spent years in US prison there before returning to Syria to join the insurgency against Bashar al-Assad.

The meeting - following Trump's announcement of an end to US sanctions on Syria - is a huge boost for Sharaa as he tries to bring the fractured country under his control and revive its economy, and Trump said he was looking to normalise ties with Damascus.

""He's got the potential - he's a real leader,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One after meeting Sharaa, whom he described as a young, attractive guy with a very strong past. ""He's got a real shot at holding it together,"" Trump said.

Sharaa took power after his Islamist fighters launched an offensive from their enclave in the northwest in 2024 and toppled Assad, whose allies Russia and Iran were distracted by other wars.

He was long better known as Abu Mohammad al-Golani, his nom de guerre as commander of the Nusra Front, an insurgent group fighting Assad and for years al Qaeda's official wing in the conflict.

He cut ties with al Qaeda in 2016, gradually recasting his group as part of the Syrian revolution rather than global jihad.

Sharaa swapped combat fatigues for suits and ties after entering Damascus as Syria's de facto ruler in December 2024, promising to replace Assad's brutal police state with an inclusive and just order.

He cited priorities including reuniting Syria, reviving an economy choked by sanctions and bringing arms under state authority. His administration won significant backing from Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

But he has struggled to meet his aims as armed groups kept their weapons, sanctions remained and sectarian killings left minority groups afraid of his rule.

Israel, alleging Sharaa remains a jihadist, has declared south Syria off limits to his forces. It said a strike near the presidential palace in Damascus on May 2 was a warning that it would not let Syrian forces deploy south of the capital or allow any threat to Syria's Druze minority.

The challenges were demonstrated in March when Assad loyalists attacked government forces in the coastal region, prompting a wave of revenge killing in which Islamist gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, from which Assad hailed.

It amplified fears about the jihadist roots of Syria's new ruling group despite Sharaa's promises of tolerance and accountability for the killings. Fears of a slide back towards authoritarian rule were hardened by a temporary constitution focusing power in his hands.

SHARIA LAW

Sharaa characterised Assad's defeat as a God-given victory.

He sidestepped interviewers' questions on whether he thought Syria should apply Islamic sharia law, saying it was for experts to decide. The temporary constitution strengthened its role.

He cited revolutionary legitimacy for his designation as interim president. He has said elections will take place, but that Syria needs up to five years to organise them properly.

In a Reuters interview at the presidential palace, Sharaa underlined his intention to turn the page on Assad's rule.

""My chest tightens in this palace. I'm astonished by how much evil against society emanated from every corner,"" he said.

Sharaa was born in Saudi Arabia, where he spent the first years of his life before moving to Syria. His father was an Arab nationalist, an ideology at odds with Sharaa's political Islam.

In a 2021 interview with the US Public Broadcasting Service's FRONTLINE programme, Sharaa said he was influenced by the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising against Israeli occupation, which began in 2000.

He returned to Syria from Iraq once the uprising began, sent by the leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State group in Iraq at the time, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, to build up al Qaeda's presence.

The US designated Sharaa a terrorist in 2013, saying al Qaeda in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad's rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria. It said the Nusra Front had carried out suicide attacks that killed civilians and espoused a violent sectarian vision.

Sharaa gave his first media interview in 2013, his face wrapped in a scarf and showing his back to the camera. He told Al Jazeera Syria should be run according to sharia law.

In his 2021 FRONTLINE interview, he faced the camera in a shirt and jacket. He said the terrorist designation was unfair and that he opposed the killing of innocent people.

Asked about his views on the September 11 attacks at the time they happened, Sharaa said anybody in the Arab or Islamic world who said ""he wasn't happy would be lying to you, because people felt the injustice of the Americans in their support of the Zionists, their policies towards Muslims in general, and their clear and strong support of the tyrants in the region"".

""But people regret the killing of innocent people, for sure,"" he said.

The Nusra Front had never presented a threat to the West, he said. Despite its al Qaeda ties, Nusra was regarded as relatively less heavy handed in dealings with civilians and other rebel groups than Islamic State.

 Israel issues evacuation warnings in Yemen as Trump visits Gulf ,"
                        
                        
                        Israel issued evacuation warnings on Wednesday for three seaports in Yemen after saying the Iran-aligned Houthis had fired a missile towards it.

It reported the missile launch while US President Donald Trump was on a visit to three Gulf states - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

The Israeli army said the Ras Issa, Hodeidah and Salif ports were being used by the Iran-aligned Houthi group. Israel had said earlier that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen towards its territory.

Trump, who started an intensified military campaign against Houthi strongholds in Yemen on Mar 15, agreed to an Oman-mediated ceasefire deal with the group, which said the accord did not include Israel.

The Houthis have been launching missiles and drones at Israel, as well as attacking vessels in global shipping lanes, in a campaign that they say is aimed at showing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza as Israel presses on with its military campaign there.

Trump said on Tuesday the Houthis had agreed to stop interrupting important shipping lanes in the Middle East.

                        The Israeli military said on Wednesday that it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen towards its territory.

The launch coincides with US President Donald Trump's visit to the Gulf. Trump has announced that he reached a ceasefire with Yemen's Houthis that will halt attacks on US vessels.

The Iran-aligned group fired a missile towards Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, according to the group's military spokesperson Yahya Saree.

Trump announced early in May that the US would stop bombing the Houthis in Yemen as the group had agreed to stop attacking US ships.

The Houthis said they will continue to fire missiles and drones towards Israel.

The Houthis have attacked numerous vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting global trade, in a campaign that they say is aimed at showing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

 France's Macron says Russia could face new sanctions if no ceasefire ,"
                        
                        
                        French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he was in favour of imposing new sanctions on Russia in coming days if Moscow failed to agree to a ceasefire, mentioning financial services and oil and gas as possible targets.

""Our intention is to impose new sanctions against Russia in the coming days"" if Moscow refuses to implement a ceasefire, Macron said in a prime-time interview on TF1. ""We are coordinating in this regard.""

Macron's comments echoed those by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz earlier on Tuesday, who said European allies would roll out ""a significant tightening of sanctions"" on Russia if President Vladimir Putin does not agree to a ceasefire.

Merz also cited sectors including energy and financial markets as possible targets. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Monday the European Commission had been asked to propose new sanctions in those areas.

The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland said on Saturday that Russia would be hit by new punitive measures if it did not heed calls for a 30-day ceasefire within days.

That pledge failed to move Putin, who instead called for direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15. US President Donald Trump backed that call, undermining the European leaders' efforts to show Trump was firmly on board with their threat.

Diplomats say after 16 sanction packages imposed on Russia by the EU over the war in Ukraine, it is increasingly difficult to achieve necessary unanimity among the bloc's 27 members to pass major new measures.

" Trump meets Syrian president, urges him to establish ties with Israel ","
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump met with Syria's president in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and urged him to normalise ties with longtime foe Israel, after a surprise US announcement that it would lift all sanctions on the Islamist-led government.

Trump met Syria's Ahmed al-Sharaa, who once pledged allegiance to al Qaeda and swept to power at the head of a group that Washington has called a terrorist organisation, before a summit between the United States and Gulf Arab countries. 

He urged Sharaa to join the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, which normalised relations with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, the White House press secretary posted on X.

Trump said he thought Syria would join at some point, according to a Washington Post pool report.

""I think they have to get themselves straightened up. I told him, 'I hope you‚Äôre going to join when it‚Äôs straightened out.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô But they have a lot of work to do,"" said Trump.

Photos posted on Saudi state television showed them shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS.

Despite concerns within sectors of his own administration over Syria's leaders' former ties to al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.

Trump's Middle East trip has fuelled doubts in Israel about where the country stands in Washington's priorities.

The US exploring the possibility of normalising ties with Syria, one of Israel's biggest foes, and holding nuclear talks with its other enemy Iran has sidelined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies in the government.

Israel considers Iran's nuclear programme ""an existential threat"" and does not trust Syria's new Islamist president. Israeli officials have continued to describe Sharaa as a jihadist, though he severed ties with al Qaeda in 2016.

The Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump, who said his Gulf region trip does not sideline Israel, told reporters the fact he has relationships with countries in the Middle East is ""very good for Israel"".

He said the meeting with Sharaa, who he described as a young, attractive guy with a very strong past, was ""great"".

""He's got a real shot at holding it together,"" said Trump.

Sharaa was for years the leader of al Qaeda's official wing in the Syrian conflict.

He first joined the group in Iraq, where he spent five years in a US prison. The United States removed a $10 million bounty on his head in December.

The US also hopes regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords, but discussions came to a halt after the Gaza war erupted and the kingdom insists there can be no normalisation without Palestinian statehood.

BOOST FOR SYRIA'S NEW LEADERS

The decision to lift sanctions is a boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.

Removing US barriers that cut Syria off from the global financial system will clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organisations and will ease foreign investment and trade as the country rebuilds from a civil war.

Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud told a press conference that there are many investment opportunities in Syria and Riyadh will support its economic recovery.

Israel, which counts the US as its strongest ally, opposes sanctions relief for Syria and has escalated military strikes there since Assad was toppled, saying it will not tolerate an Islamist presence in southern Syria.

The challenges facing Syria's new government were also laid bare in March when Assad loyalists assailed government forces, prompting attacks in which Islamist gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, drawing US condemnation.

The Syrian foreign minister said on Wednesday the meeting between Trump and Sharaa included discussions about combating terrorism and cooperation in eliminating the influence of armed groups that threaten Syrian stability, including Islamic State.

This meeting will be followed by another between the Syrian foreign minister and his US counterpart Marco Rubio.

BUSINESS DEALS

Trump's first day of a four-day swing through the Gulf region brought a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in US arms sales to the kingdom.

On Wednesday, Trump flew to the Qatari capital Doha, which he helped isolate in 2017, when he lent support to a trade and diplomatic embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt on Qatar. They accused the tiny but wealthy gas producer of backing terrorism among other charges.

Qatar has since sought to rehabilitate itself in Washington's eyes and Doha's efforts have been rewarded by the first visit to Qatar by a US president in 23 years.

The United States and Qatar signed agreements on defence and aircraft deals, with Qatar Airways ordering 160 Boeing jets for over $200 billion.

 Harvard expands lawsuit after Trump cancels $450 million more in grants ,"
                        
                        
                        Harvard University expanded its lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's moves to cut off billions of dollars in federal funding on Tuesday, after officials said they were terminating an additional $450 million in grants.
Harvard filed the amended complaint in federal court in Boston just hours after a federal antisemitism task force announced that eight government agencies were cancelling more grants, on top of the $2.2 billion in funding the administration had already frozen.
The task force -- which includes representatives from the US departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice -- said the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based school had failed to address ‚Äúpervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus‚Äù.
In response, Harvard broadened a lawsuit it first filed on Apr 22 to cover the latest research-grant terminations, which came from agencies including the US departments of Defense and Energy, as well as the National Science Foundation.
The revised complaint also now challenges a decision announced last week in a letter from Education Secretary Linda McMahon to freeze billions of dollars in future research grants and other federal aid until the university concedes to the administration‚Äôs demands.
Harvard argues the administration's sweeping actions violate the free speech guarantees of the US Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment. The university also says the massive funding freeze is overly broad and was implemented without following proper procedures.
‚ÄúThe Government has not identified -- and cannot identify -- any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen or terminated,‚Äù the lawsuit said.
Harvard is asking US District Judge Allison Burroughs to declare the administration‚Äôs actions unlawful and block the grant terminations. She previously scheduled arguments in the case for July 21.
Trump has targeted Harvard, citing allegations of antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests on campus. The demonstrations were sparked by US ally Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza following the October 2023 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants.
Trump has claimed that pro-Palestinian protesters are antisemitic and sympathetic to Hamas. Protesters -- including some Jewish groups -- argue that the government wrongly conflates criticism of Israel‚Äôs military actions with antisemitism, and advocacy for Palestinian rights with extremism.
The Trump administration began cancelling funding after launching a review in late March of roughly $9 billion in grants and contracts linked to Harvard. Trump has also threatened to strip the university of its tax-exempt status.
In its complaint, Harvard said it is committed to combating antisemitism and has taken steps to ensure that its campus is safe and welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students. It argued that the administration‚Äôs actions pose a threat to academic freedom.
While Harvard has a $53 billion endowment -- the largest of any US university -- the school noted that much of it is restricted and earmarked for purposes such as financial aid and scholarships.

 Houthi ceasefire followed US intel showing militants sought off-ramp ,"
                        
                        
                        Days before a surprise US ceasefire agreement with Houthis, US intelligence started picking up indications the Yemeni fighters were looking for an exit after seven weeks of relentless US bombings, four US officials said.

Houthi leaders began reaching out sometime around the first weekend in May to US allies in the Middle East, two of the officials said.

""We started getting intel that the Houthis had had enough,"" one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity to recount the internal discussions about the intelligence, which haven't been previously reported.

Interviews with current and former US officials, diplomatic sources and other experts show how a campaign that the US military's Central Command once envisioned might stretch through most of this year came to abrupt halt on May 6 after 52 days, allowing President Donald Trump to declare victory before heading to the Middle East this week.

Since November 2023, the Houthis have disrupted commerce by launching hundreds of drone and missile attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, saying they were targeting ships linked to Israel in solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza.

Two sources said Iran played an important role in encouraging the Iran-aligned Houthis to negotiate, as Tehran pursues its own talks with the United States over its nuclear program aimed at ending crippling US sanctions and preventing a military strike by the US or Israel.

But the culmination of the ceasefire accord underscored how quickly the Trump administration moved on initial intelligence to secure what in March seemed unthinkable to many experts in the short term: a Houthi declaration it would stop striking US ships. Trump's unconventional approach included bypassing close US ally Israel, which is not covered by the agreement, and which was not told ahead of time, an Israeli official and a person familiar with the matter said.

The Houthis weren't the only ones feeling pressure. The bombing campaign has also been costly to the United States, which has burned through munitions and lost two aircraft and multiple drones.

After the early Maytips on the Houthis, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth initiated a series of meetings at the White House on Monday morning, and concluded there was a window of opportunity with the Iran-aligned fighters, one of the officials said.

Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was already leading US negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme, worked through Omani mediators and held indirect talks with the chief Houthi negotiator and spokesperson, Mohammed Abdulsalam, two US officials told Reuters.

Abdulsalam was in turn in contact with the Houthis' top leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, one of the officials said.

A framework agreement was reached later on Monday, one of the officials said.

By Tuesday, May 6, Trump was ready to announce an accord, declaring the Houthis had capitulated.

""They said please don't bomb us any more and we're not going to attack your ships,"" he told reporters.

Asked about Reuters' findings, the Houthis' Abdulsalam said the group communicated only via Oman and agreed to the ceasefire because the Houthis had been responding to the United States defensively.

""So if they stopped their aggression, we stopped our response,"" Abdusalam told Reuters, declining further comment.

A spokesperson for Witkoff did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

OFF-RAMP

Each side saw some benefit to striking a deal. For the Houthis, it offered an off-ramp that could allow them to rebuild and relieve pressure that, over months or years, could have strategically put them at risk, US officials and experts say.

Washington's allies in the region also wanted out, one source said.

""Because if the Houthis were under more pressure, their response was going to be to fire on the Saudis or the Emiratis,"" one person familiar with the matter said.

At the start of the US campaign on March 15, al-Houthi was defiant, saying in a televised address that his fighters would target US ships in the Red Sea as long as the US continued its attacks on Yemen.

At the time, it appeared the United States might be locked in a costly standoff with a group known for its resiliency, as US forces used up munitions during more than 1,100 strikes. Hegseth said the US would only halt its bombings once the Houthis agreed to stop striking US ships and drones.

The Houthis shot down seven US MQ-9 drones -- each worth tens of millions of dollars -- since Trump took office.

The Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, whose deployment in the Middle East was extended by Hegseth, lost two fighter jets, including one falling from the deck of the ship after the massive vessel was forced to make a hard turn because of a Houthi attack in the area.

Some analysts questioned the wisdom of the US strategy. The Houthis had already endured nearly a decade of heavy strikes launched by a Saudi-led military coalition, but were able to rebuild to the point where they could threaten the US Navy and Israel.

One of the US officials said a turning point for the Houthis came on April 17, when the United States targeted the Houthi-controlled Ras Isa fuel terminal on the Red Sea coast.

It was the deadliest strike to that point, with the Houthi-run Health Ministry saying 74 people were killed. The Pentagon has not commented on specific numbers of people killed in individual strikes.

""That (damaged) their ability to conduct operations and generate revenue,"" the official said, describing efforts to squeeze the group economically.

Asked for comment, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly told Reuters Trump's ceasefire was ""another good deal for America and our security.""

""The objective at the outset was securing the freedom of navigation, and that was achieved through the restoration of American deterrence.""

Pentagon spokesperson Marine Colonel Chris Devine said in response to Reuters' findings that the US military campaign successfully degraded Houthi capabilities and ""set the stage for the President to achieve a ceasefire agreement.""

LONGER CAMPAIGN PROPOSED

Trump's campaign to weaken the Houthis came after failed attempts to deter and degrade the group during the Biden administration.

The US military's Central Command recommended a campaign, lasting at least eight months, that would include a gradual shift to more targeted strikes from the broader ones that took place in the first few weeks, the official added.

The bombings cost well over $1 billion, officials say, and killed a significant number of mid-tier Houthi fighters who trained lower-level forces, as well as destroyed multiple command facilities, air defense systems, weapons manufacturing and storage facilities.

They also destroyed stocks of anti-ship ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, aerial drones and drone ships.

But the strikes didn't cut Houthi supply lines or fray higher level leadership, and three experts cautioned the group may rapidly recover.

The group's persistent attacks on Israel also demonstrate that it retains significant capability, despite the US campaign. Those have continued after the May 6 ceasefire announcement.

US officials and other sources also caution that it is unclear how long the ceasefire will hold, and if the Houthis will continue to see the United States and Israel as separate threats, especially as Israel retaliates against Yemen.

""Proxies of Iran and Iran don't distinguish between what is Israel and what is the United States,"" one person familiar with the situation said.

""Their view is that anything Israel does is enabled by the United States. So at some point, I think the Houthis will see themselves as trying to hold the United States accountable.""

" Trump lavishes praise on Saudi crown prince, signalling renewed alliance ","
                        
                        
                        Four years ago, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman struggled to get an audience with then-President Joe Biden, who said he wanted to make the Gulf country a pariah after its leader allegedly ordered the murder of a Washington-based journalist.
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump lavished effusive praise on Saudi's de facto ruler, calling him ""an incredible man"" and a ""great guy,"" and made no mention of human rights concerns in the country.
""I like him a lot. I like him too much,"" Trump gushed as cameras flashed and the crowd applauded at an investment summit in Riyadh, where the US president kicked off the first major overseas trip of his second term.
The display of affection for a leader with a contentious history mirrored Trump's first term, when he forged an alliance with bin Salman that deepened through years of mutual flattery and dealmaking.
The relationship remains anchored in shared interests: Trump is chasing major economic wins and a revived US role in the region, while bin Salman seeks access to advanced technology, military support and a powerful ally in his push to modernise Saudi Arabia and assert regional leadership.
At the summit, Trump touted a $142 billion defence agreement and a sweeping $600 billion Saudi investment package spanning artificial intelligence, infrastructure and energy.
Trump's ties with the crown prince have sparked criticism from US lawmakers, human rights groups and foreign policy analysts for what they viewed as prioritising economic interests over human rights.
While bin Salman has denied involvement in journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder and pointed to reforms such as expanding women's rights as evidence of progress, analysts said these changes were undercut by continued crackdowns on dissent and political freedoms.
Trump's rapport with bin Salman is far warmer than his White House predecessor's. Yet Biden's relationship with the Saudi leader took a friendlier turn too, evolving from initial harsh criticism to pragmatic cordiality.
BIDEN OPTS FOR RESET
In 2019, the Democratic president promised to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" on the world stage for Khashoggi's killing and its broader human rights record.
But geopolitical realities such as skyrocketing oil prices caused in part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 highlighted a need for cooperation between Washington and Riyadh.
That led Biden to decide it was time to reset the strategic relationship, and he eventually visited the crown prince in July 2022.
The two men greeted each other with a fist bump, which drew some criticism as an overly friendly gesture given human rights concerns. White House aides insisted it was a way to lower Biden's risk of contracting COVID-19.
Relations improved quickly as his administration worked to broker a deal for normalising Saudi-Israeli relations in exchange for a broader US defence agreement. The effort was frozen by the Oct 7, 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel and Israel's subsequent war on Gaza.
During Trump's visit on Tuesday, the crown prince personally greeted the US president, escorting him up an escalator and later driving him in a golf cart ahead of a state dinner.
In a moment that underscored the depth of their personal bond, Trump pledged to lift US sanctions on Syria -- a dramatic move that he said came at bin Salman's request.
""Oh, what I do for the crown prince,"" Trump said, as the crown prince placed his hands over his heart and led a standing ovation.

 How India and Pakistan pulled back from the brink with US-brokered ceasefire ,"
                        
                        
                        At 2:09am on Saturday, Ahmad Subhan, who lives near an air base in the Pakistan military garrison city of Rawalpindi, heard the first explosion that rattled the windows of his house -- and took South Asia to the brink of war.
As dawn broke, the heaviest fighting in decades between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan reached a crescendo, after nearly three weeks of escalating tensions.
Fighter jets and missiles crisscrossed the skies of one of the world's most populated regions. Pakistani officials said they would convene an emergency meeting of their top nuclear decision-making body.
The critical eight-hour window also saw Indian missile barrages on three major Pakistani air bases and other facilities, including Nur Khan, which is ringed by civilian homes like Subhan's, and just a 20-minute drive to the capital, Islamabad.
After the initial blast, Subhan and his wife grabbed their three children and ran out of their home. ""We were just figuring out what had happened when there was another explosion,"" said the retired government employee, who remembered the precise time of the strike because he was just about to make a call.
This account of Saturday's events -- which began with the looming specter of a full-blown war and ended with an evening cease-fire announcement by US President Donald Trump -- is based on interviews with 14 people, including US, Indian and Pakistani officials, as well as Reuters' review of public statements from the three capitals.
They described the rapid escalation of hostilities as well as behind-the-scenes diplomacy involving the US, India and Pakistan, and underscore the key role played by Washington in brokering peace.
The attack on Nur Khan air base saw at least two missile strikes as well as drone attacks, according to Subhan and two Pakistani security officials, who like some of the people interviewed by Reuters, spoke on condition of anonymity.
The barrage took out two roofs and hit the hangar of a refuelling plane, which was airborne at the time, according to one of the officials, who visited the base the next day.
A senior Indian military officer, however, told reporters on Sunday that an operations command center at Nur Khan had been hit.
""The attack on Nur Khan ... close to our capital, that left us with no option but to retaliate,"" Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Reuters.
Nur Khan is located just over a mile from the military-run body responsible for Pakistan's nuclear planning.
So, an attack on the facility may have been perceived as more dangerous than India intended -- and the two sides should not conclude that it is possible to have a conflict without it going nuclear, said Christopher Clary, an associate professor at the University at Albany in New York.
""If you are playing Russian roulette and pull the trigger, the lesson isn't that you should pull the trigger again,"" said Clary.
India's defence and foreign ministries, as well as Pakistan's military and its foreign ministry, did not immediately respond to written questions submitted by Reuters.
A US State Department spokesperson did not directly respond to questions from Reuters about the American role, but said that further military escalation posed a serious threat to regional stability.
VANCE CALLS MODI
India and Pakistan have fought three major wars and been at loggerheads since their independence. The spark for the latest chaos was an April 22 attack in Indian Kashmir that killed 26 people, most of them tourists. New Delhi blamed the incident on ""terrorists"" backed by Pakistan, a charge denied by Islamabad.
It was the latest of many disputes involving Kashmir, a Himalayan territory ravaged by an anti-India insurgency since the late 1980s. Both New Delhi and Islamabad claim the region in full but only control parts of it.
Hindu-majority India has accused its Muslim-majority neighbour of arming and backing militant groups operating in Kashmir, but Pakistan maintains it only provides diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.
After a go-ahead from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indian military on May 7 carried out air strikes on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Pakistan, in response to the April attack in Kashmir.
In air battles that followed, Pakistan said it shot down five Indian aircraft, including prized Rafale planes New Delhi recently acquired from France. India has indicated that it suffered losses and inflicted some of its own.
Senior US officials became seriously concerned by Friday, May 9 that the conflict was at risk of spiralling out of control, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Another source familiar with the matter said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a series of calls from May 6-8 with Indian and Pakistani officials, including with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the foreign ministers and national security advisers of both countries.


Then on the morning of May 9, Rubio and US Vice President JD Vance discussed with Trump in the Oval Office a plan for Vance to call Modi to underscore that Washington ""believed there was a high probability for dramatic escalation as the conflict entered its fourth day,"" the source said.
""The vice president encouraged Modi to consider de-escalatory options, outlining a potential off-ramp that Secretary Rubio and his staff understood the Pakistanis would be amenable to,"" the source added.
Rubio then engaged in ""a marathon session of telephone diplomacy"" with Indian and Pakistani officials into the early morning of May 10 to get the parties talking and reach an agreement on a ceasefire, the source said.
The US intervention came despite Vance saying publicly on Thursday that the US was ""not going to get involved in the middle of war that's fundamentally none of our business.""
The sources didn't provide specifics but said Modi was non-committal. One of the people also said that Modi told Vance, who had been visiting India during the Kashmir attack, that any Pakistani escalation would be met by an even more forceful response.
Hours later, according to Indian officials, that escalation came: Pakistan launched attacks on at least 26 locations in India in the early hours of May 10.
Pakistan said their strikes occurred only after the pre-dawn Indian attack on its air bases, including Nur Khan.
NUCLEAR SIGNALS
A little over an hour after that Indian attack began, Pakistan military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry confirmed Indian strikes on three air bases.
Some Indian strikes on Saturday, May 10 also utilised the supersonic BrahMos missile, according to a Pakistani official and an Indian source. Pakistan believes the BrahMos is nuclear-capable, though India says it carries a conventional warhead.
By 5 am local time on Saturday, Pakistan's military announced it had launched operations against Indian air bases and other facilities.
About two hours later, Pakistani officials told journalists that Prime Minister Sharif had called a meeting of the National Command Authority, which oversees the nuclear arsenal.
Dar told Reuters on Tuesday that any international alarm was overblown: ""There was no such concern. There should not be. We are a responsible nation.""
But signalling an intention to convene NCA reflected how much the crisis had escalated and ""may also have been an indirect call for external mediation,"" said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia expert.
About an hour after the NCA announcement, the US said Rubio had spoken to Pakistan Army Chief Gen Asim Munir -- widely regarded as the most powerful man in that country -- and was pushing both sides to de-escalate.
Rubio also soon got on the phone with Dar and Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar.
""Rubio said that Indians were ready to stop,"" Dar told Reuters. ""I said if they are ready to stop, ask them to stop, we will stop.""
An Indian official with knowledge of Rubio's call with Jaishankar said that Rubio passed on a message that the Pakistanis were willing to stop firing if India would also cease.
'GREAT INTELLIGENCE'
Pakistan Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, who only days earlier warned of conflict, dialled into a local TV news channel at around 10:30am on Saturday.
Two-and-a-half hours after Pakistani officials shared news of the NCA meeting, Asif declared that no such event had been scheduled, putting a lid on the matter.
The international intervention anchored by Rubio paved the way to a cessation of hostilities formalized in a mid-afternoon phone call between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO) of India and Pakistan. The two spoke again on Monday.
Pakistan Lt Gen Chaudhry said in a briefing that New Delhi had initially requested a call between the DGMOs after the Indian military's May 7 strikes across the border.
Islamabad only responded to the request on Saturday, following its retaliation and requests from international interlocutors, according to Chaudhry, who did not name the countries.
Almost exactly 12 hours after Pakistan said it had launched retaliatory strikes against India for hitting three key air bases, Trump declared on social media there would be a cessation of hostilities.
""Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" he said.

" Trump says US to lift Syria sanctions, secures $600 billion Saudi deal ","
                        
                        
                        President Donald Trump kicked off his trip to the Gulf on Tuesday with a surprise announcement that the United States will lift long-standing sanctions on Syria, and a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US

The US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, according to the White House which called it the largest ""defense cooperation agreement"" Washington has ever done.

The end of sanctions on Syria would be a huge boost for a country that has been shattered by more than a decade of civil war. Rebels led by current President Ahmed al-Sharaa toppled President Bashar al-Assad last December.

Speaking at an investment forum in Riyadh at the start of a deals-focused trip that also brought a flurry of diplomacy, Trump said he was acting on a request to scrap the sanctions by Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

""Oh what I do for the crown prince,"" Trump said, drawing laughs from the audience. He said the sanctions had served an important function but that it was now time for the country to move forward.

The move represents a major US policy shift. The US declared Syria a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979, added sanctions in 2004 and imposed further sanctions after the civil war broke out in 2011.

Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said on X that the planned move marked a ""new start"" in Syria's path to reconstruction. Trump has agreed to briefly greet Sharaa in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a White House official said.

Trump and the Saudi crown prince signed an agreement covering energy, defense, mining and other areas. Trump has sought to strengthen relations with the Saudis to improve regional ties with Israel and act as a bulwark against Iran.

The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen US defence companies for areas including air and missile defense, air force and space, maritime security and communications, a White House fact sheet said.

It was not clear whether the deal included Lockheed F-35 jets, which sources say have been discussed. The Saudi prince said the total package could reach $1 trillion when further agreements are reached in the months ahead.

Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms, and the two countries have maintained strong ties for decades based on an arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and the superpower provides security.

But relations were strained after the 2018 murder of US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul caused a global uproar. US intelligence concluded that bin Salman approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, a prominent critic, but the Saudi government has denied any involvement.

Trump did not mention the incident during his visit and called bin Salman an ""incredible man.""

""I really believe we like each other a lot,"" Trump said.

Trump will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday in a trip that is focused on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East.

Several US business leaders attended the event, including Elon Musk, the Tesla chief who has led a government-downsizing effort for Trump in Washington; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman; BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.

Trump was shown speaking with several Saudi officials, including sovereign wealth fund governor Yasir al-Rumayyan, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser and investment minister Khalid al-Falih as he viewed models for the kingdom‚Äôs flashy, multi-billion-dollar development projects.

Bin Salman has focused on diversifying the Saudi economy in a major reform program dubbed Vision 2030 that includes ""Giga-projects"" such as NEOM, a futuristic city the size of Belgium. Oil generated 62% of Saudi government revenue last year.

The kingdom has scaled back some of its ambitions as rising costs and falling oil prices weigh.

NO VISIT TO ISRAEL, WARNING TO IRAN

Trump has not scheduled a stop in Israel, raising questions about where the close ally stands in Washington's priorities as Trump presses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire deal in the 19-month-old Gaza war.

Israel's military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and its assassinations of the two Iran-allied groups' leaders, have at the same time given Trump more leverage by weakening Tehran and its regional allies.

Trump said it was his ""fervent hope"" that Saudi Arabia would soon normalize relations with Israel, following other Arab states that did so during his first 2017-2021 term. ""But you'll do it in your own time,"" he said.

Netanyahu's opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress with the Saudis unlikely, sources told Reuters.

Trump on Tuesday called Iran ""the most destructive force"" in the Middle East and warned that the US will never allow it to obtain a nuclear weapon. He said he was willing to strike a new deal with the Islamic Republic but only if its leaders changed course.

""I want to make a deal with Iran,"" he said. ""But if Iran's leadership rejects this olive branch... we will have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure.""

 Israeli strike on Gaza hospital kills wounded journalist ,"
                        
                        
                        An Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday killed a well-known Palestinian journalist whom it accused of working with Hamas and was recovering in hospital from an earlier strike, the territory's health ministry said.

Israel accused Hassan Aslih, who has hundreds of thousands of followers on social media platforms, of taking part in the October 7, 2023 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas that triggered the war in Gaza.

It said Aslih had documented and uploaded footage of ""looting, arson and murder"" during the Hamas-led incursion into Israel.

Ahmed Siyyam, a Gaza civil emergency service member, told Reuters the attack hit the third floor of a Nasser Hospital building in the southern city of Khan Younis, where dozens of patients and injured were being treated.

Two patients, including Aslih, were killed and several others were wounded, the health ministry said.

Later on Tuesday, the Gaza health ministry also said nine missiles slammed into and around the courtyard of the Gaza European Hospital in the south of the enclave, killing at least 16 people and wounding 70 others.

The fate of several others remained unclear as rescue operations were underway, a civil emergency official told Reuters.

The Israeli military said it had struck a ""Hamas command centre"" beneath the hospital. It accuses Hamas of exploiting hospitals and civilian properties for military purposes, which the group denies.

HEAVY DAMAGE

Israel's military said in a statement about the Nasser Hospital that it struck ""significant Hamas terrorists who were operating from within a command and control center"" located at the hospital. It didn't name them.

Reuters footage showed heavy damage to one of the hospital buildings, including to the medical equipment and beds inside.

""I came to the hospital not knowing whether to mourn the martyrs, treat the patients and injured, or deal with the staff who no longer feel safe,"" said Atef Al-Hout, director of Nasser Hospital.

According to the International Federation of Journalists, at least 160 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war.

Officials in Gaza, where Hamas took control in 2007, put the number at 215, and accuse Israel of deliberately targeting journalists. Israel denies targeting journalists and says it tries to avoid harm to civilians.

Aslih headed the Alam24 news outlet and worked as a freelance photojournalist. He had previously worked with several Western news organizations. He was wounded last month in a deadly strike on a tent in the Nasser hospital compound.

Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in the October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's response has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of the enclave.

A blockade on aid supplies since March 2 has left the population at critical risk of famine, according to a UN-backed monitor.

A senior World Health Organization official warned on Tuesday that hunger and malnutrition could have a lasting impact on ""an entire generation"".

" Russian economy in worse shape than Moscow says, report for EU shows ","
                        
                        
                        The Russian economy is in an increasingly precarious state as a result of a shift to a war mode and of Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a report by the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics (SITE) said on Tuesday.

The report, prepared for talks of European Union finance ministers, said that while still relatively stable, the Russian economy was only superficially resilient and that underlying imbalances and structural weaknesses were growing.

""The fiscal stimulus of the war economy has kept the economy afloat in the short term, but the reliance on opaque financing, distortionary resource allocation, and shrinking fiscal buffers makes it unsustainable in the long term. Contrary to Kremlin narratives, time is not on Russia's side,"" it said.

The EU has imposed 16 packages of sanctions on Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, targeting Moscow's main sources of revenue - oil, gas and coal exports. Other Western powers, including the United States, Canada, Britain and Japan also imposed sanctions.

Keen to show Western sanctions are pointless, Russia says its gross domestic product grew 4.3% in 2024 after 3.6 percent expansion in 2023.

But Torbjorn Becker, who presented the SITE report to EU finance ministers, said Russian GDP numbers could not be trusted because Moscow was most likely strongly understating inflation which affected real GDP calculations.

""Russia claims inflation is 9-10 percent. Why would they then have a policy rate of 21 percent at the central bank? Which regular central bank would have a policy rate that's basically 11.50 percentage points higher than the inflation rate? If any of our central banks were doing something like that, they would be out of their job the next day,"" Becker told reporters.

""That's a very clear indication that inflation may not actually be the right number. If you understate inflation, you will then overstate real GDP numbers,"" he said.

LIKELY HIGHER BUDGET DEFICIT

He also pointed to Russia's budget constraints caused by falling revenues from oil, gas and coal and rising military spending. Since the start of its invasion of Ukraine and despite its massive war effort, Russia has been reporting a budget deficit of 2 percent of GDP every year.

""Fiscal numbers in Russia don't really correspond to what we think that they are putting into the war effort,"" Becker said.

He said much of the financing of the war machine was going through the banking system. ""So if you add that to the fiscal numbers, their fiscal deficits would be ballpark twice as high as what they have shown in the official statistics,"" he said.

This, in turn, was building up financial risks in the banking system, Becker said, because banks were reporting high credit growth.

""These are all indicators that we usually look at when we want to predict the banking crisis,"" Becker said.

European Economic Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said the European Commission agreed with the SITE report.

""Their analysis highlights the unreliability of Russian statistics, and how the Russian economy is not performing as well as its official statistics suggest,"" Dombrovskis told reporters after the EU ministers' meeting.

""The Commission broadly agrees with this analysis and the overall increasing fragility of the Russian economy. This underlines the importance of the international community's ongoing efforts to limit the Kremlin's capacity to continue its war of aggression against Ukraine,"" he said.

In a telephone interview from Kyiv, Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said the Ukrainian president would be willing to hold talks with any other world leaders on the sidelines of the inauguration.

He added that the new pontiff had told Zelensky in a telephone call on Monday that he was ready to facilitate such meetings and had promised to ""do his best"" to help bring about a just and lasting peace.

Leo, who was elected in a conclave that ended last Thursday, will be officially installed as the new leader of the world‚Äôs 1.4 billion Roman Catholics at a Mass in St Peter's Square on Sunday. A number of world leaders are expected to attend.

                        Donald Trump has agreed to say hello to Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a White House official said, during the US president's regional tour that began with a stop in Riyadh.

There were no immediate details about the format of any exchange between Sharaa and Trump, but any meeting will mark a dramatic turnaround for the Syrian president, a former rebel leader who swept to power last year at the head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group linked to al Qaeda and designated a terrorist organisation by Washington.

Saudi Arabia, as Trump's host on the first stop of his regional tour, alongside Qatar and Turkey, both supporters of the new Syrian administration, had been pushing hard for the meeting between Sharaa and the US president, at least four sources had previously told Reuters.

But several sources had said they were cautious about whether it would proceed as they await Trump's nod of approval.

Sharaa has won support from wealthy Gulf states and Syria's northern neighbour Turkey as he rebuilds his nation shattered by more than a decade of conflict, but has made slower progress with the West, with only limited success in securing any easing of US sanctions.

The agreement, signed during US President Donald Trump's visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh, covers deals with more than a dozen US defence companies in areas including air and missile defence, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said.

""The package signed today, the largest defence cooperation deal in US history, is a clear demonstration of our commitment to strengthening our partnership,"" the fact sheet said.

Reuters first reported last month that the arms package would be worth well over $100 billion.

Saudi Arabia is the largest customer for US arms.

Former President Joe Biden's administration tried unsuccessfully to finalise a defence pact with Riyadh as part of a broad deal that envisioned Saudi Arabia normalising ties with Israel.

The White House fact sheet did not mention if Riyadh would be permitted to purchase Lockheed's F-35 jets, the military aircraft that the kingdom has reportedly been interested in for years.

The two countries had discussed Riyadh's potential purchase of Lockheed's F-35 jets, two sources briefed on discussions told Reuters.

However, it was not clear if Washington would permit the kingdom to move forward with a purchase that would give Saudi Arabia an advanced weapon used by close US ally Israel, one of the sources said.

The second source said the qualitative military edge, or US guarantees that Israel receives more advanced American weapons than Arab states, is an issue that ""has come up.""

The sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Israel has owned F-35s for nine years, building multiple squadrons.

Governments in the Gulf have long sought the most advanced fighter jet, built with stealth technology allowing it to evade enemy detection. If the US did approve the transfer, Saudi Arabia would be only the second Middle East state after Israel to operate F-35 fighters.

Nigeria, which has grappled with an Islamist insurgency for over 15 years, has this year witnessed a surge in attacks by Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province in Borno, the heartland of the militants.

Two soldiers from the 24 Task Force Brigade in Borno's Dikwa district said militants flew two surveillance drones in the vicinity before attacking the brigade's base around 1 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Tuesday.

The base also housed some troops from the 153 Battalion in nearby Marte district, which was attacked on Monday with at least five soldiers killed.

                        President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday he would attend talks with Russia on the war in Ukraine this week only if Vladimir Putin is also there, and goaded him by saying the Russian leader was scared to meet him face-to-face.

The Kremlin has yet to say whether Putin will take part in the talks scheduled to be held in Istanbul on Thursday, more than three years into the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two.

The planned talks have become the main focus of peace efforts led by US President Donald Trump, who is sending senior envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, three sources familiar with the plans said. Trump has also offered to attend.

Zelensky said he wanted to negotiate an unconditional 30-day ceasefire as the first step towards ending the war, and that Putin must take part in talks because ""absolutely everything in Russia"" depends on him.

""If he takes the step to say he is ready for a ceasefire, then it opens the way to discussing all the elements to end the war,"" he said. ""He is scared of direct talks with me.""

Both Moscow and Kyiv have sought to show they are working towards peace after Trump prioritised ending the war, which has raged since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but have yet to agree on any clear path.

Putin on Sunday proposed direct talks with Ukraine, after ignoring a Ukrainian offer of an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Trump publicly told Zelensky to accept the proposal.

The Ukrainian leader then said he would be waiting for Putin in Istanbul on Thursday, though the Kremlin chief had never made clear he intended to travel himself.

A senior US official said it was unclear whether anyone from the Russian government would show up.

Asked who would represent Russia at the talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: ""As soon as the president sees fit, we will announce it.""

CEASEFIRE EFFORTS

Reuters reported last year that Putin was open to discussing a ceasefire with Trump but that Moscow ruled out making any major territorial concessions and demanded that Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO.

Ukraine has said it is ready for talks but a ceasefire is needed first, a position supported by its European allies.

Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, on Tuesday reiterated Ukraine's stance that any negotiations must come after a ceasefire.

A senior Russian official, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying Moscow was ready for serious talks on Ukraine but doubted Kyiv's capacity for negotiations.

The agencies quoted him as saying realities ""on the ground"" should be recognised, including the incorporation of what Moscow calls ""new territories"" into Russia - a reference to territory in Ukraine that is occupied by Russian forces.

US officials want Russia to agree to a comprehensive 30-day land, air, sea and critical infrastructure ceasefire, a senior US official said. European nations have threatened to impose more sanctions on Russia if it does not agree to the ceasefire.

 India approves more Russian insurers to provide marine cover ,"
                        
                        
                        India has approved three Russian insurers, including a unit of top lender Sberbank, to provide marine cover to ships arriving at Indian ports, a government notification shows, helping Moscow maintain oil supplies to a key market.

India is the top buyer of Russian seaborne oil after China since Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its military action in Ukraine.

With the granting of the permits to Sberbank Insurance, Ugoria Insurance Group and ASTK Insurance Company, India now recognises eight Russian entities that are eligible to provide protection and indemnity (P&I) coverage for ships.

The permits for Sberbank Insurance, Ugoria and ASTK are valid until February 20, 2026, the order showed.

Reuters last month reported that the three entities were seeking approval from the Indian shipping regulator to provide P&I cover.

Insurance is essential for maritime transport, particularly oil cargoes that require the highest safety standards due to the risk of spills.

Russian entities are not a part of the International Group of P&I Clubs, which provides liability cover for personal injury or environmental clean-up claims for the majority of the world's tankers.

Growing scrutiny of Russia's oil supply chain by the United States and the European Union, including compliance with a price cap set by the Group of Seven democracies for the use of Western ships and insurance, has made it increasingly difficult for Moscow to export its oil.

To navigate the restriction, Indian refiners buy Russian oil on delivered basis, with sellers providing vessels and insurance.

 UK police arrest man for arson after fire at PM Starmer‚Äôs house ,"
                        
                        
                        British police said on Tuesday they had arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of arson after counter-terrorism officers launched an investigation into three fires, including one at Prime Minister Keir Starmer's private home.

Police were called to reports of a fire in the early hours of Monday morning at the property in Kentish Town in north London, the area that Starmer represents in parliament.

Nobody was injured but damage was caused to the property's entrance, police said.

The man was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life in connection with the fire and two further incidents, police said.

He remains in custody, they added.

Police are investigating whether a fire at the entrance of a property in nearby Islington on Sunday and a vehicle fire in Kentish Town on Thursday are linked to the incident on Monday.

A BBC report said the Islington property was also connected to the prime minister.

Starmer lived in the terraced house on a back street with his wife and two children before he moved into Number 10 Downing Street when he became prime minister last July.

Officers from London's Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command were leading the investigation due to the property's connections with a high-profile public figure, police said.

His spokesperson thanked the emergency services for their work on Monday.

 Trump starts Gulf visit focusing on mega economic deals ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday at the start of a four-day visit to the wealthy Gulf region, focusing more on economic deals than regional security matters ranging from war in Gaza to talks on Iran's nuclear program.

With a who's who of powerful American business leaders in tow, Trump is visiting Riyadh, site of a Saudi-US Investment Forum, before going to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday. He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington's priorities.

""While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over,"" Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih said as he opened the forum.

""As a result ... when Saudis and Americans join forces very good things happen, more often than not great things happen when those joint ventures happen,"" he said before Trump's arrival.

Trump is hoping to secure trillions of dollars of investments from the Gulf oil producers. Saudi Arabia had pledged $600 billion but Trump has said he wants $1 trillion from the kingdom, one of Washington's most important allies.

The Saudi-US Investment Forum began with a video showing soaring eagles and falcons and celebrating the long history between the United States and the kingdom.

At the front of a palatial hall sat Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, Stephen A. Schwartzman, CEO of Blackstone, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan and Falih.

Speaking at a forum panel as Trump touched down in Riyadh, Fink said he had traveled to Saudi Arabia more than 65 times over 20 years. While the kingdom had been a follower when he first started visiting, it was now ""taking control"" and broadening its economy out of its oil base, he said.

After landing, Trump punched the air when he caught sight of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, before shaking hands with the de facto leader.

MbS has focused on diversifying the kingdom's economy in a major reform programme dubbed Vision 2030 that includes ""Giga-projects"" such as NEOM, a futuristic city the size of Belgium.

The kingdom has had to scale back some of its lofty ambitions as rising costs and falling oil prices weigh.

Joining Trump for a lunch with MbS are top US businessmen including billionaire Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

LONG TIES BASED ON OIL AND SECURITY

Saudi Arabia and the US have maintained strong ties for decades based on an ironclad arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and the superpower provides security.

Trump has also said he may travel on Thursday to Turkey for potential talks between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Russia's war in Ukraine. An aide to Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian president would take part only if Putin does. The Russian leader has not said if he will attend, and has questioned Zelenskiy's legitimacy.

Trump's second foreign trip since returning to the presidency in January - his first was to Rome for Pope Francis' funeral - comes at a time of geopolitical tension.

In addition to pressing for a settlement in Ukraine, his administration is pushing for a new aid mechanism for Gaza after 19 months of war and urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree a new ceasefire deal there.

Israeli officials have put a brave face on Trump's decision to bypass Israel during his trip but there are growing doubts in Israel about its position in his priorities as frustration mounts in Washington over the failure to end the Gaza war.

Over the weekend, US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program. Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails.

Iran's Nournews quoted armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri as saying on Tuesday that Iran's neighbours should retain neutrality and that any aggression against Iran would lead to definitive retaliation.

Trump is expected to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth more than $100 billion, sources told Reuters. This could include a range of advanced weapons.

Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expected progress imminently on expanding the Abraham Accords, a set of deals brokered by Trump in his first term by which Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco recognised Israel.

But opposition by Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with Riyadh unlikely, sources told Reuters.

" Detained in The Hague, Philippines' Duterte wins hometown mayoral election ","
                        
                        
                        Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was almost certain to be elected mayor of his home city by a landslide on Monday, unimpeded by his detention at the International Criminal Court on charges of murder as a crime against humanity.

With 80% of votes counted in an unofficial tally, Duterte, who was brought to The Hague in March over his bloody ""war on drugs"" that killed thousands of people, was winning the Davao mayoral contest with eight times more votes than his nearest rival.

The victory during nationwide midterm elections is testament to the 80-year-old's enduring influence in the southern city, owing to his reputation as a crime-buster that earned him the nicknames ""Duterte Harry"" and ""the Punisher"".

Duterte's old Facebook account was flooded with congratulatory messages from supporters, with some calling for his return to serve his people.

""Congratulations, Tatay (father) D! Let's bring him home,"" read one of the comments.

Duterte could become the first Asian former head of state to go on trial at the ICC.

His surprise arrest by Philippine police at the request of the ICC caused outrage among his army of supporters, who called it a kidnapping at the behest of a foreign court.

He has defended the anti-drugs crackdown and his legal team says his arrest was unlawful. The ICC maintains it has jurisdiction to prosecute alleged crimes committed before Duterte withdrew the Philippines from its founding treaty in 2019.

Despite the ICC's case also including alleged killings of criminal suspects by a ""death squad"" in Davao while Duterte was mayor - which he has denied - analysts have said his arrest has only hardened support for him and his family, in Davao and beyond.

The former president's two sons were also set to win posts on Monday, one reelected congressman and the other winning the contest for Davao vice mayor and likely to serve in his father's absence.

The family's political resilience and dominance in Davao could prove pivotal as Duterte's popular daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, faces an impeachment trial that could see her banned from politics for life if convicted, killing off any hopes of a presidential run.

Asked earlier on Monday about her father's likely victory, she said plans would be made for him to be sworn in as mayor.

""The ICC lawyer said once we get proclamation papers, we will discuss how he can take oath,"" she said.

 Trump executive order demands pharma industry price cuts ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump signed a wide-reaching executive order on Monday directing drugmakers to lower the prices of their medicines to align with what other countries pay that analysts and legal experts said would be difficult to implement.

The order gives drugmakers price targets in the next 30 days, and will take further action to lower prices if those companies do not make ""significant progress"" toward those goals.

The order was not as bad as feared, investors, analysts and drug pricing experts said, and they questioned how it would be implemented. Shares of drugmakers, which had been down on the threat of ""most favoured nation"" pricing, recovered and rose on Monday.

Trump told a press conference that the government would impose tariffs if the prices in the US did not match those in other countries and said he was seeking cuts of between 59% and 90%.

""Everybody should equalize. Everybody should pay the same price,"" Trump said.

The United States pays the highest prices for prescription drugs, often nearly three times more than other developed nations. Trump tried in his first term to bring the US in line with other countries but was blocked by the courts.

Trump's drug pricing proposal comes as the president has sought to fulfil a campaign promise of tackling inflation and lowering prices for a host of everyday items for Americans, from eggs to gas for their cars.

Trump said his order on drug prices was partly a result of a conversation with an unnamed friend who told the president he got a weight-loss injection for $88 in London and that the same medicine in the US cost $1,300.

If drugmakers do not meet the government‚Äôs expectations, it will use rulemaking to bring drug prices to international levels and consider a range of other measures, including importing medicines from other developed nations and implementing export restrictions, a copy of the order showed.

Trump's order directs the government to consider facilitating direct-to-consumer purchasing programs that would sell drugs at the prices other countries pay.

Trade groups representing biotech and pharmaceutical companies decried the move.

""Importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers. It would mean less treatments and cures and would jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America,"" Stephen Ubl, CEO of industry trade group PhRMA, said in a statement.

Ubl said the real reasons for high drug prices are ""foreign countries not paying their fair share and middlemen driving up prices for US patients.""

The order also directs the US Federal Trade Commission to consider aggressive enforcement against what the government calls anti-competitive practices by drugmakers.

During a briefing, a White House official pointed to tactics the pharmaceutical industry uses to prevent competition, such as deals with generic companies to delay market entry of cheaper alternatives, as enforcement targets.

'A FLOOD OF LITIGATION'

The executive order is likely to face legal challenges, particularly for exceeding limits set by US law, including on imports of drugs from abroad, said health policy lawyer Paul Kim. ""The order's suggestion of broader or direct-to-consumer importation stretches well beyond what the statute allows.""

Such challenges are likely months away, and will come after the Trump administration takes more concrete action to force companies to lower prices instead of the ‚Äúscattershot threats‚Äù included in the executive order, according to Lawrence Gostin, a professor of health law at Georgetown Law.

‚ÄúAt the point when there are actual consequences and we know what they are, and when companies feel that they have to lower the price of their drugs, at that point we're going to have a flood of litigation,‚Äù Gostin said.

The Federal Trade Commission has a long history of antitrust enforcement actions against drugmakers and other healthcare companies. Trump last month ordered the FTC to coordinate with other federal agencies to hold listening sessions on anticompetitive practices in the drug industry.

On Monday, Trump was expected to ask the FTC to consider taking enforcement action, sources said.

""President Donald Trump campaigned on lowering drug costs and today he‚Äôs doing just that. Americans are tired of getting ripped off. The Federal Trade Commission will be a proud partner in this new effort,"" said FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson.

Shares of major drugmakers, after initially falling during premarket trading, rallied on Monday along with the broader market. Shares of Merck & Co MRK.N closed up 5.8%, while Pfizer PFE.N gained 3.6% and Gilead Sciences GILD.O finished up 7.1%. Eli Lilly LLY.N, the world's largest drugmaker by market value, rose 2.9%.

Analysts said the order did not contain the kinds of detailed plans for price cuts that would raise concerns.

""Implementing something like this is pretty challenging. He tried to do this before and it was stopped by the courts,"" said Evan Seigerman, analyst at BMO Capital Markets.

Trump's order directs the government to consider facilitating direct-to-consumer purchasing programs that would sell drugs at the prices other countries pay.

It also orders the Secretary of Commerce and other agency heads to review and consider actions regarding the export of pharmaceutical drugs or ingredients that may contribute to price differences. The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Freed Israeli-American hostage leaves Gaza ,"
                        
                        
                        An Israeli-American hostage was released from 19 months of captivity in Gaza during a brief pause in fighting on Monday and reunited with his family, but Israeli strikes on the battered enclave soon resumed.

Israel's military received Edan Alexander, 21, from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which facilitated his transfer from Palestinian militant group Hamas.

He was taken to an Israeli military facility and joined by his family. Video showed that his mother, Yael Alexander, cried as she hugged him, saying: ""How strong you are. I love you so much, Edan. We were so worried.""

Alexander kissed and embraced his father, brother and sister as well. An Israeli Air Force helicopter then took Alexander and his family to a hospital where he was to receive treatment.

Alexander was the last living American held by Hamas and Israel's Channel 12 said his condition was ""low"", without citing a source. In photos provided by Israel, he looked pale but in good spirits.

Fighting halted at midday in Gaza after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would pause its operations to allow for the hostage release.

Palestinian health officials reported Israeli tank shelling and an air attack after the hostage handover, and there was no deal on a wider truce or hostage releases as monitors warned of famine in the devastated enclave.

After Israeli fire resumed, authorities in Gaza said an air strike killed three people and wounded several others at a shelter housing displaced families in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.



A woman was killed and several other people wounded when tank shells hit a school housing displaced families in the Tuffah neighborhood in the north of Gaza.

Hamas said it freed Alexander as a goodwill gesture to U.S. President Donald Trump, who is visiting the region this week.

""Edan Alexander, American hostage thought dead, to be released by Hamas. Great news!"" Trump wrote on social media earlier on Monday.

Netanyahu said Alexander's release came thanks to Israel's military pressure in Gaza and political pressure by Trump.

In a photo taken on the military helicopter and released by Israel, Alexander held a sign reading: ""Thank you, president Trump.""

Netanyahu has said there will be no ceasefire and that plans to intensify military action in Gaza continued. ""Israel has not committed to a ceasefire of any kind,"" Netanyahu's office said.

After growing up in New Jersey, Alexander, who has dual citizenship, moved to Israel and was serving in the Israeli army when he was captured in Hamas' 2023 attack.

Social media video on Monday showed people dancing in the square of his hometown of Tenafly, New Jersey, after word of his release.

The release, after four-way talks between Hamas, the United States, Egypt and Qatar, could open the way to freeing the remaining 58 hostages in the Gaza Strip, 19 months after Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

Qatar and Egypt said Alexander's release was an encouraging step towards new truce talks. Israel will send a delegation to Qatar on Thursday to discuss a new proposal aimed at securing further hostage releases, Netanyahu's office said.

Before Alexander's release, Gaza health authorities said an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people sheltering at a school on Monday. Israel's military said it targeted Hamas fighters there who were preparing an attack.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global hunger monitor, reported on Monday that half a million people in the Gaza Strip face starvation and there is a critical risk of famine by September.

'BRING THEM ALL HOME'

Trump is due to visit Gulf states on a trip that does not include Israel but special envoy Steve Witkoff, who helped arrange Alexander's release, was expected in Israel on Monday.

Alexander's family thanked Trump and Witkoff, saying they hoped the release would hasten the freeing of the remaining hostages. ""We urge the Israeli government and the negotiating teams: please don't stop,"" they said.

Israel's government has drawn criticism over the deal to free Alexander, which laid bare the priority given to hostages able to rely on the support of a foreign government.

Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among 21 hostages still believed to be alive, said Netanyahu was choosing his political survival over ending the war.

Addressing Trump in a statement she read with other hostage families, she said: ""The Israeli people are behind you. End this war. Bring them all home"".

A ceasefire in late January halted fighting in Gaza for two months and allowed the exchange of 38 hostages for Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails. Israel resumed its military campaign in March.

It has since extended its control of the territory and blocked off aid, leaving its 2 million people increasingly short of food.

Israeli forces invaded Gaza after a Hamas-led assault on Israel in October 2023 that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, over 52,000 Palestinians have been killed, Palestinian authorities say, and large swathes of the heavily built-up enclave have been laid to waste.

 Rush of diplomatic calls follow Trump's offer to join potential Russia-Ukraine talks ,"
                        
                        
                        US and European diplomats went on a flurry of calls in the hours after US President Donald Trump offered on Monday to join prospective Ukraine-Russia talks later this week, trying to find a path that would bring an end to the war in Ukraine.

Trump's surprise offer to join the talks on Thursday in Istanbul came a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a fresh twist to the stop-start peace talks process, said he would travel to Turkey and wait to meet President Vladimir Putin there.

After Trump's announcement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the ""way forward for a ceasefire"" in Ukraine with European counterparts, including the foreign ministers of Britain and France, and the EU's foreign policy chief, the State Department said on Monday.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and his German and Polish counterparts were also on the call, according to the readout.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held talks late on Monday with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan to discuss Moscow's direct talks with Kyiv - a proposal that came from Putin at the weekend, the Russian foreign ministry said.

It remained unclear who would travel from Moscow to Istanbul to take part in the direct talks, which would be the first between the two sides since the early days of the war that Russia launched with its invasion on Ukraine in February 2022.

There has been no response from the Kremlin to Zelenskiy's offer to meet Putin in Istanbul and Moscow was yet to comment on Trump's offer to join the talks.

If Zelenskiy and Putin, who make no secret of their contempt for each other, were to meet on Thursday it would be their first face-to-face meeting since December 2019.

""Don't underestimate Thursday in Turkey,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday.

Trump's current schedule has him visiting Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar this week.

Ukraine and its European allies have been seeking to put pressure on Moscow to accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from Monday, with the leaders of four major European powers travelling to Kyiv on Saturday to show unity with Zelenskiy.

Earlier on Monday, the German government said Europe would start preparing new sanctions against Russia unless the Kremlin by the end of the day started abiding by the ceasefire.

Ukraine's military said on Monday that fighting along parts of the frontline in the country's east was at the same intensity it would be if there were no ceasefire.

Putin called the Western European and Ukrainian demands for a ceasefire ""ultimatums"" that the Kremlin said on Monday are for Russia an unacceptable language.

Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international affairs committee of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament, told the Izvestia media outlet in remarks published on Tuesday that the talks between Moscow and Kyiv can move further than they did in the 2022.

""If the Ukrainian delegation shows up at these talks with a mandate to abandon any ultimatums and look for common ground, I am sure that we could move forward even further than we did,"" Izvestia cited Kosachev as saying.

 Trump says it would be 'stupid' not to accept gift of Qatari plane ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump dismissed ethical concerns about his plan to accept an airplane as a gift from the Qatari royal family, saying on Monday it would be ""stupid"" to turn down the generous offer.

The $400 million luxury plane, which would be outfitted to serve as Air Force One, would be one of the most valuable gifts ever received by the US government. News of the offer drew immediate criticism from Democrats and advocates of good government, who warned it was a conflict of interest that could influence presidential decisions.

Trump said the Boeing 747-8 airplane would eventually be donated to his presidential library - a repository housing research materials from his administration-and that he had no plans to use it for personal reasons after leaving office.

""I think it's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving for a trip to the Middle East.

""I mean, I could be a stupid person saying, 'No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane,'"" Trump said.

The Republican president attributed the offer to gratitude for US help in the defence of countries in the region including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, all stops on his itinerary this week.

Trump also said accepting it was a practical decision, and that he was disappointed that Boeing has taken so long to deliver the new Air Force One planes he commissioned during his first term as president.

Critics of the offer said it was unethical and likely unconstitutional.

Democratic Senators Brian Schatz, Chris Murphy, Cory Booker and Chris Coons said in a statement that Trump's acceptance of such a gift would create a clear conflict of interest, raise serious national security questions and invite foreign influence.

US Representative Joe Courtney of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said it would distract from the Air Force‚Äôs efforts to speed up delivery of the actual new Air Force One fleet.

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said legal details surrounding the donation to the Defence Department were still being worked out and that the Trump administration was not worried about what the Qataris might ask for in return.

                        Hundreds of thousands of devotees of the Virgin Mary on Monday gathered at the sanctuary of Fatima in Portugal to pray for newly-appointed Pope Leo XIV and global peace.

Church officials said around 270,000 pilgrims came from all over Portugal, Spain, Poland and from further afield nations such as the US, Paraguay, Mauritius and Taiwan, packing one of Catholicism's most famous shrines located less than 150 kilometres (95 miles) north of Lisbon.

In his first Sunday address to crowds in St Peter's Square since his election, Pope Leo appealed to the world's major powers for ""no more war"", while on Monday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had spoken by phone with the pontiff about ceasefire proposals to end its war with Russia.

Portuguese pilgrim Conceicao Teixeira, 77, said she hoped Leo would continue his predecessor Pope Francis' legacy of ""humanity and sincerity.""

""The hearts (of men) are very hard, people do not stop to think and there is so much inhumanity, indifference and iniquity,"" she told Reuters, just before the candlelight procession, the highlight of the evening, began.



Christel, a 41-year-old pilgrim for Mauritius, said Pope Leo ""seems like someone who will make peace and try to get everyone along with him"".

Every May 12 and 13, thousands of pilgrims head to the Fatima sanctuary, many of them walking long distances, to celebrate the first of the reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary to three shepherd children in 1917.

The Catholic Church believes she appeared six times that year to the children, revealing to them the so-called three secrets of Fatima.

The Vatican later interpreted the prophecies as foretelling Communism's persecution of Christianity, including the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981.

 First white South Africans arrive in US as Trump claims they face discrimination ,"
                        
                        
                        The Trump administration welcomed on Monday 59 white South Africans it granted refugee status in the US, having deemed them victims of racial discrimination, while drawing criticism from Democrats and stirring confusion in South Africa.

US President Donald Trump has blocked mostly non-white refugee admissions from the rest of the world but in February offered to resettle Afrikaners, the descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, saying they faced discrimination.

Asked on Monday why white South Africans were being prioritised above the victims of famine and war elsewhere in Africa, Trump said, without providing evidence, that Afrikaners were being killed.

‚ÄúIt's a genocide that's taking place,"" Trump told reporters at the White House, going further than he has previously in echoing right-wing tropes about their alleged persecution.

He was not favouring Afrikaners because they are white, Trump said, adding that their race ""makes no difference to me.""

South Africa maintains there is no evidence of persecution and that claims of a ""white genocide"" in the country, echoed by Trump's white South African-born ally Elon Musk, have not been backed up by evidence.

The Episcopal Church announced on Monday that it would no longer work with the federal government on refugees after it was asked to help settle the Afrikaners.

""It has been painful to watch one group of refugees, selected in a highly unusual manner, receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or dangerous conditions for years,"" Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe wrote in a letter to the church's followers.



US Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the move ""baffling.""

""The decision by this administration to put one group at the front of the line is clearly politically motivated and an effort to rewrite history,"" she said in a statement on Monday.

LAND LAW

US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau greeted the first 59 Afrikaners to arrive in a hangar at Washington's Dulles airport. He compared their journey to that of his own father, a Jew from Austria who fled Europe in the 1930s, first to South America and then to the United States.

Landau did not repeat Trump's claims of killings, but said many of the South Africans were farming families who had worked land for generations but now faced the threat of that land being expropriated, as well as threats of violence.

Trump's February order on resettling Afrikaners cited a land law introduced by South Africa this year that aims to make it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest, which has caused concern among some white South Africans although no land has been seized.

Charl Kleinhaus, 46, who arrived on Monday and was set to be resettled in Buffalo, New York, with his daughter, son and grandson, said his life was threatened and people tried to claim his property as their own. Reuters was unable to verify his account.

""We never expected this land expropriation thing to go so far,"" he told Reuters.

Some of the Afrikaners were heading to Democratic-leaning Minnesota, which has a reputation for welcoming refugees, while others planned to go to Republican-led states such as Idaho and Alabama, sources told Reuters.

The US would welcome more Afrikaner refugees in the coming months, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.

'WRONG END OF THE STICK'?

Since his return to the White House in January, Trump has cut all US financial assistance to South Africa, citing disapproval of its land policy and of its genocide case at the International Court of Justice against Washington's ally Israel.

Speaking at a conference in Ivory Coast, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the white Afrikaners had ostensibly left because they were opposed to policies aimed at addressing racial inequality persisting since apartheid, or white minority, rule ended three decades ago.

""We think that the American government has got the wrong end of the stick here, but we'll continue talking to them,"" he said.

Trump said that South Africa's leadership was traveling to see him next week and that he would not travel to a G20 meeting there in November unless the ""situation is taken care of.""

Since Nelson Mandela won South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994, the once-ruling white minority has retained most of its wealth amassed since colonial times.

Whites still own three-quarters of private land and have about 20 times the wealth of the Black majority, according to international academic journal the Review of Political Economy.

Less than 10% of white South Africans are out of work, compared with more than a third of their Black counterparts.

 Pakistan finance minister: conflict with India won't have large fiscal impact ,"
                        
                        
                        The recent military escalation with arch-rival India won't have a large fiscal impact on Pakistan and can be managed within the current fiscal space, with no need for a new economic assessment, Pakistan's Finance Minister said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.

Trade talks with the United States ‚Äì which had played a key role mediating a ceasefire between the two countries ‚Äì would likely have progress in ‚Äúshort order‚Äù and that Pakistan could import more high-quality cotton, more soy beans and was also exploring other asset classes, including hydrocarbons, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said in the online interview.

On Monday, US President Donald Trump said the US is ready to help India and Pakistan after a ceasefire agreement, claiming trade was a big reason they ""stopped fighting"".

Pakistan faces a 29% tariff on exports to the US due to an approximate $3 billion trade surplus, but this is currently under a 90-day pause announced in April.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday approved a $1 billion loan disbursement to Pakistan as part of a larger $7 billion bailout agreement.

Aurangzeb said Islamabad would receive the tranche disbursement on Tuesday.

The IMF executive board also approved a fresh $1.4 billion loan to Pakistan under its climate resilience facility.

The federal budget for the next fiscal year, starting July, will be finalised within the next three to four weeks, with scheduled budget talks with the IMF to take place from May 14-23, he said.

Regarding the India-Pakistan conflict, Aurangzeb described it as a ""short duration escalation"" with minimal fiscal impact, stating it can be ""accommodated within the fiscal space which is available to the government of Pakistan"".

When questioned about potential increased military spending in the upcoming budget, Aurangzeb deferred comment, saying it was premature to discuss specific plans. However, he said: ""Whatever we need to do in terms of ensuring that our defence requirements are met will be met.""

Aurangzeb said he expects the Indus Water Treaty, which India unilaterally suspended, to be reinstated and rolled back to where it was.

He said there is not going to be any immediate impact from India's suspension and Pakistan does not ""even want to consider any scenario which does not take into account the reinstatement of this treaty.""

Tensions between India and Pakistan began mounting after the April 22 attack in Indian Kashmir on Hindu tourists that killed 26 people, sparking the worst clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours in more than two decades.

On Saturday, a ceasefire in the Himalayan region was announced by Trump, following four days of fighting and diplomacy and pressure from Washington.

 Australia's Albanese Labour government sworn in for second term ,"
                        
                        
                        Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was sworn in for a second term on Tuesday, alongside his ministers, after a landslide win at a national election he said had returned the largest centre-left Labour government since federation in 1901.

Albanese's Labour Party rode a voter backlash against global instability caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's policies to a come-from-behind victory on May 3.

The opposition conservative Liberal Party, whose leader Peter Dutton lost his seat at the election, selected Sussan Ley as its new leader on Tuesday, a party spokeswoman told reporters.

Ley will become the first woman leader of the federal Liberal Party, which lost city seats in Sydney and Melbourne to women who ran as independent candidates with policies supporting climate change and gender equality in the last two elections.

""Australia spoke very clearly to the Liberal Party,"" Liberal Senator Linda Reynolds told reporters on Tuesday after Ley's win.

The Australian Electoral Commission is yet to finalise vote counting in several seats, although Labour has claimed at least 92 seats out of the 150-seat House of Representatives.

It was the largest Labour caucus since Australia was formed by the federation of six former British colonies in 1901, Albanese said on Monday.

Albanese and his ministers were sworn in at a ceremony at Government House in Canberra, conducted by Governor-General Sam Mostyn.

The key roles of the treasurer, foreign affairs, defence and trade are unchanged. In new roles, Michelle Rowland was sworn in as attorney-general, Murray Watt as environment minister, and Tanya Plibersek as social services minister.

Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran Black said in a statement the ministry showed stability, adding that industry wanted to see reform of environment laws.

""With one in four jobs being trade dependent, it's crucial that business and government continue to secure new opportunities abroad to grow our economy at a time of geopolitical uncertainty,"" said Black.

Albanese will travel to Indonesia on Wednesday, and will attend the inauguration mass of Pope Leo XIV on Sunday in Rome, where he said he would also hold meetings with other leaders, including European Union president Ursula von der Leyen to discuss trade.

 How Trump's chaotic trade war has evolved ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump's tariff decisions since he took office on January 20, from imposing sweeping duties to abruptly pausing some of them, have shocked financial markets and sent a wave of uncertainty through the global economy.
Here is a timeline of the major developments:
February 1 - Trump imposes 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10 percent on goods from China, demanding they curb the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the United States.
February 3 - Trump suspends his threat of tariffs on Mexico and Canada, agreeing to a 30-day pause in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement. The US does not reach such a deal with China.
February 7 - Trump delays tariffs on de minimis, or low-cost, packages from China until the Commerce Department can confirm that procedures and systems are in place to process them and collect tariff revenue.
February 10 - Trump raises tariffs on steel and aluminium to a flat 25 percent ""without exceptions or exemptions"".
March 3 - Trump says 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada will take effect from March 4 and doubles fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 percent.
March 5 - The president agrees to delay tariffs for one month on some vehicles built in Canada and Mexico after a call with the CEOs of General Motors and Ford and the chair of Stellantis.
March 6 - Trump exempts goods from Canada and Mexico under a North American trade pact for a month from the 25 percent tariffs.
March 26 - Trump unveils a 25 percent tariff on imported cars and light trucks.
April 2 - Trump announces global tariffs with a baseline of 10 percent across all imports and significantly higher duties on some of the US' biggest trading partners.
April 9 - Trump pauses for 90 days most of his country-specific tariffs that kicked in less than 24 hours earlier following an upheaval in financial markets that erased trillions of dollars from bourses around the world.
The 10% blanket duty on almost all US imports stays in place.
Trump says he will raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125 percent from the 104 percent level that took effect a day earlier. This pushes the extra duties on Chinese goods to 145 percent, including the fentanyl-related tariffs imposed earlier.
April 13 - The US administration grants exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China.
April 22 - The Trump administration launches national security probes under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962 into imports of both pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on both sectors.
May 4 - Trump imposes a 100 percent tariff on all movies produced outside the US.
May 9 - Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announce a limited bilateral trade agreement that leaves in place 10 percent tariffs on British exports, modestly expands agricultural access for both countries and lowers prohibitive US duties on British car exports.
May 12 - The US and China agree to temporarily slash reciprocal tariffs. Under the 90-day truce, the US will cut the extra tariffs it imposed on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China's duties on US imports will be slashed to 10 percent from 125 percent.

Syria has struggled to implement conditions set out by Washington for relief from US sanctions, which keep the country cut off from the global financial system and make economic recovery extremely challenging after 14 years of grinding war.

""We may take them off of Syria, because we want to give them a fresh start,"" Trump told reporters.

He said he had been asked about Syria sanctions by Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

""Many people have asked me about that, because the way we have them sanctioned, it doesn't really give them much of a start. So we want to see we can help them out,"" Trump said.

 Food safety violation leads to close of Rupashi Bangla restaurant in Abu Dhabi ,"
                        
                        
                        A Bengali restaurant in Abu Dhabi has been shut down by the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority for violating food safety standards, reports Khaleej Times.

The closure came due to a serious breach of food safety regulations, posing a significant risk to public health.

Situated on Hamdan Bin Mohammed Street, Rupashi Bangla Restaurant LLC received an administrative closure notice from inspectors following a food control report that uncovered multiple high-risk violations, said Khaleej Times.

According to the authority, the restaurant ignored previous warnings and continued to violate essential food safety standards, endangering the wellbeing of their patrons.

The restaurant will remain closed until all violations are resolved, achieving full compliance with food service requirements, and mitigating any threats to public health.

The business will only be permitted to reopen once it meets all the safety requirements.

As per Khaleej Times, this action comes in the wake of two additional closures last week: Mana Ruchulu Restaurant and Wafi Hypermarket, reflecting the authority‚Äôs ongoing crackdown on non-compliance within the food sector.

 Trump offers to join potential Russia-Ukraine talks in Turkey ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump offered on Monday to join prospective Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey later this week as European countries pushed to get the Kremlin to accept their demand for a 30-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine.

Trump spoke a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a fresh twist to the stop-start peace talks process, said he would travel to Istanbul where, he said, he would be waiting to meet Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Trump told reporters at the White House that talks in Istanbul could be helpful and he might join them on Thursday while in the region. His current schedule has him visiting Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar this week.

""I've got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there. There's a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen, but we've got to get it done,"" he said before departing for his second foreign trip since his second term in the White House began in January.

""Don't underestimate Thursday in Turkey,"" he said.

In response to Trump's remarks, Zelensky said in a post on X: ""I hope that the Russians will not evade the meeting. And of course, all of us in Ukraine would appreciate it if President Trump could be there with us at this meeting in Turkey."" He added that such participation was ""the right idea"".

Earlier on Monday, the German government said Europe will start preparing new sanctions against Russia unless the Kremlin by the end of the day starts abiding by a 30-day ceasefire in its war with Ukraine.

Ukraine's military said Russia had conducted dozens of attacks along the front in eastern Ukraine on Monday as well as an overnight assault using more than 100 drones, despite the ceasefire proposal by Europe and Kyiv.

""The clock is ticking,"" a German government spokesperson said at a news conference in Berlin.

It is not clear though how much impact fresh European sanctions would have on Russia, especially if the United States does not join in as well.

The leaders of four major European powers travelled to Kyiv on Saturday and demanded an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from Monday. Putin, implicitly rejecting the offer, instead proposed direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul that he said could potentially lead to a ceasefire.

The Kremlin has not responded to that latest proposal. Putin and Zelensky have not met since December 2019 - over two years before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - and make no secret of their contempt for each other.

Responding to the proposal of a ceasefire, Russia said at the weekend it is committed to ending the war but that European powers were using the language of confrontation.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Russia was ""completely ignoring"" the ceasefire initiative, citing what he said were continued attacks on Ukrainian forces.

He said he shared information about the continued fighting with European partners and with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on a joint phone call. The allies had agreed sanctions would be needed to pressure Russia if it snubbed the truce move.

Russia and Ukraine are both trying to show Trump that they are working towards his objective of reaching a rapid peace in Ukraine, while trying to make the other look like the spoiler to his efforts.

FIGHTING CONTINUES

The Ukrainian military's general staff said that as of 4pm (1300 GMT) on Monday there had been 69 clashes with Russian forces along the front line since midnight, when the ceasefire was to have come into effect.

The intensity of the fighting was at the same level it would be if there were no ceasefire, said Viktor Trehubov, a spokesperson for the military on Ukraine's eastern front.

The Ukrainian air force said Ukraine came under attack overnight from 108 long-range combat drones starting from 11pm (2000 GMT), an hour before the proposed ceasefire was due to kick in. Attacks of this kind unfold over the course of hours as drones fly much slower than missiles.

Russia also launched guided bombs at targets in the northeastern Kharkiv region and the northern Sumy region, the air force said, while the Ukrainian state railway company said a Russian drone hit a civilian freight train in the east.

Kyiv is desperate to unlock more of the US military backing it received from Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden. Moscow senses an opportunity to get relief from a barrage of economic sanctions and engage with the world's biggest economy.

Europe meanwhile is doing its best to preserve good relations with Trump despite his imposition of tariffs, hoping it can persuade him to swing more forcefully behind Ukraine's cause, which they see as central to the continent's security.

" Freed Israeli-American hostage leaves Gaza, Israel says no ceasefire ","
                        
                        
                        An Israeli-American hostage crossed into Israel on Monday after his release by Hamas amid a pause in fighting in Gaza, the Israeli military said, but there was no deal on a wider truce or hostage releases as monitors warned of famine in the devastated enclave.

Israel's military said it had received Edan Alexander after the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had facilitated his safe transfer from 19 months of captivity to Israeli authorities.

Alexander was the last American held by Hamas and Israel's Channel 12 said his condition was ""low"", without citing a source.

Al Jazeera television showed a photograph of him standing next to masked fighters and a Red Cross official. Unlike in previous hostage releases, he was wearing civilian clothes.

Fighting halted at midday in Gaza after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would pause its operations to allow safe passage for the hostage release.

Hamas said it was freeing Alexander as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump, who is visiting the region this week.

""Edan Alexander, American hostage thought dead, to be released by Hamas. Great news!"" Trump wrote in capital letters on his social media platform earlier in the day.

Netanyahu said Alexander's release came thanks to Israel's military pressure in Gaza and political pressure by Trump.

The Israeli leader said he spoke with Trump on Monday and the US president expressed commitment to Israel, according to a statement by Netanyahu's office.

Netanyahu has said there will be no ceasefire and that plans to intensify military action in Gaza continue. Witnesses in Gaza Strip told Reuters the movement of aviation over Gaza by Israeli warplanes and drones had resumed after Alexander's handover.

The release, after four-way talks between Hamas, the United States, Egypt and Qatar, could open the way to freeing the remaining 58 hostages held in the Gaza Strip, 19 months after Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

Qatar and Egypt said Alexander's release was an encouraging step towards new truce talks. Israel will send a delegation to Qatar on Thursday to discuss a new proposal aimed at securing further hostage releases, Netanyahu's office said.

Netanyahu has insisted that Israel's planning for an expanded military campaign in Gaza will continue, as one of his far-right coalition partners, national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said the war on Islamist militant Hamas must not end and aid should not be let into the Palestinian enclave.

""Israel has not committed to a ceasefire of any kind,"" Netanyahu's office said, adding that military pressure had forced Hamas into the release.

Gaza health authorities said an Israeli strike killed at least 15 people sheltering at a school on Monday before fighting paused. Israel's military said it had targeted Hamas fighters there who were preparing an attack.

The global hunger monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) reported on Monday that half a million people in the Gaza Strip face starvation and there is a critical risk of famine by September.

'BRING THEM ALL HOME'

Trump is due to visit Gulf states on a trip that does not include a stop in Israel but special envoy Steve Witkoff, who helped arrange the release, was expected in Israel on Monday, two Israeli officials said.

Alexander's family thanked Trump and Witkoff, saying in a statement that they hoped the decision would open the way for the release of the other remaining hostages.

""We urge the Israeli government and the negotiating teams: please don't stop,"" they said.

US officials have tried to calm fears in Israel of a growing distance between Israel and Trump, who last week announced an end to US bombing of Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have continued to fire missiles at Israel.

Israel's government has drawn criticism over the deal to release Alexander, which laid bare the priority given to hostages able to rely on the support of a foreign government.

Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among 21 hostages still believed to be alive, said Netanyahu was choosing his political survival over ending the war.

Addressing Trump in a statement she read with other hostage families, she said: ""The Israeli people are behind you. End this war. Bring them all home"".

Netanyahu, who was due to testify in the latest session of his trial on corruption charges that he denies, has faced pressure from hardliners in his cabinet not to end the war.

Following a ceasefire agreement that halted fighting in Gaza for two months and allowed the exchange of 38 hostages for Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, Israel resumed its military campaign in the enclave in March.

Since then, it has extended its control of the territory, clearing around a third of what it has described as a ""security zone"" and blocked off the entry of aid into Gaza, leaving the 2 million population increasingly short of food.

Last week, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee outlined plans for a new system of aid deliveries by private contractors, but many details are unclear, including on funding.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told visiting Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday that humanitarian aid in Gaza needed to resume immediately. Herzog said the new aid mechanism would reach civilians, not Hamas, and urged the international community to help implement it.

Israeli forces invaded Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led assault on Israel in October 2023 that killed 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

Since then, more than 52,000 Palestinians have been killed, Palestinian health authorities say, and large swathes of the heavily built-up enclave have been laid to waste.

 What happened the last time Russia and Ukraine held peace talks? ,"
                        
                        
                        Russia and Ukraine may be on the point of holding peace talks for the first time since the early weeks of the war.

Here is a short guide to what was on the table back in 2022, the last time the two countries held peace talks, and why those talks broke down.

WHERE AND WHEN DID NEGOTIATIONS TAKE PLACE?

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators met in Belarus on February 28, 2022, four days after Russia's full-scale invasion. They later held meetings by video link before meeting again in person in Istanbul on March 29. After that they exchanged multiple drafts until mid-April, before the talks broke down.

WHAT WAS DISCUSSED?World

- According to draft documents published last year by the New York Times, Ukraine was prepared to become a permanently neutral, non-aligned and nuclear-free state, with no foreign troops or weapons on its soil. These terms would have barred it from joining NATO but allowed for the possibility of EU membership.

- In return, Ukraine would have received security guarantees from a group of countries including the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - Britain, China, Russia, the United States and France.

- A partially agreed draft said the guarantor states - including Russia - would respect and observe Ukraine's independence and sovereignty and refrain from the threat or use of force against it.

- The draft proposed holding talks over a period of 10-15 years regarding the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

WHAT WERE THE KEY POINTS OF DISAGREEMENT?

- If Ukraine was attacked, it wanted the guarantors to provide assistance that could include ""closing airspace over Ukraine, providing necessary weapons, using armed force in order to restore and subsequently maintain the security of Ukraine as a permanently neutral state"". But Russia insisted any decision must be agreed by all guarantor states - meaning Moscow would have a veto.

- The two sides disagreed sharply on the future size of Ukraine's armed forces and its military arsenal. For example, Kyiv was ready to agree to cap the size of its forces at 250,000, with 800 tanks and a maximum missile firing range of 280 km (174 miles). Russia was demanding limits on Ukraine of 85,000 personnel, 342 tanks and a 40 km missile range.

- Moscow demanded that Ukraine recognise Russian as an official state language and end what it considers to be discrimination against Russian-speakers, something Ukraine denies.

- Russia demanded the repeal of what it called ""laws of Ukraine on Nazification and glorification of Nazism"". Ukraine rejects the Nazism charge as absurd.

WHY DID THE TALKS BREAK DOWN?

By April 2022, the situation on the battlefield appeared to be turning in Ukraine's favour. It had beaten back Russian forces from around Kyiv and shown evidence to the world of alleged Russian war crimes that provoked international condemnation, although Moscow denied them.

Western countries were scaling up military aid to Kyiv and escalating sanctions on Moscow - all factors that made Ukraine less inclined to accede to Russian demands, according to a detailed account of the peace talks in the journal Foreign Affairs by historian Sergey Radchenko and analyst Samuel Charap.

ARE THE 2022 DRAFTS STILL RELEVANT?

US special envoy Steve Witkoff said in February that the so-called Istanbul protocols offered ""guideposts"" for negotiations between the warring sides.

A Kremlin aide said on Sunday that the peace talks being proposed now should take into account the 2022 negotiations and the fact that Russia now controls nearly a fifth of Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in December 2024 that there were no ""Istanbul agreements"", only talks in which Ukraine had responded to an ""ultimatum"" by Russia but did not sign anything.

WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE THE FAILED TALKS?

The original negotiations were focused mainly on sovereignty issues, but Russia's stance has hardened since then to include specific demands on territory. President Vladimir Putin said in June 2024 that Ukraine must withdraw entirely from four regions of the country - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - that Russia has claimed as its own but only partly controls.

Ukraine says it will never legally recognise Russian occupation of Ukrainian land. At the same time, Zelensky has acknowledged that his forces are unable at this point to take back all the lost territory and that it may be recovered over time by diplomatic means.

" Kurdish PKK disbands, ends 40-year Turkey insurgency ","
                        
                        
                        The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, which has been locked in bloody conflict with the Turkish state for more than four decades, decided to disband and end its armed struggle, a news agency close to the group reported on Monday.

The PKK's decision could boost NATO member Turkey's political and economic stability and encourage moves to ease tensions in neighbouring Iraq and also in Syria, where Kurdish forces are allied with US forces.

Since the PKK launched its insurgency in 1984, the conflict has killed more than 40,000 people, exerted a huge economic burden and fuelled social tensions. The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies.

""The PKK 12th Congress decided to dissolve the PKK's organizational structure... and end the armed struggle,"" the Firat news agency reported it as saying in the closing declaration of a congress held last week in northern Iraq, where the group is based.

The PKK held the congress in response to a February call to disband from its jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned on an island south of Istanbul since 1999. It said on Monday that he would manage the process.

However, it was not clear whether Ankara agreed to Ocalan's continued role, which polls suggest could be unpopular among Turks. Nor were details available on how the disarmament and break up of the PKK would happen in practice.

It also remained to be seen how the process would affect the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, if at all. YPG leads a US-allied force against Islamic State there and is regarded by Turkey as a PKK affiliate. YPG has previously said Ocalan's call did not apply to it.

""The PKK has completed its historic mission,"" the PKK statement said. ""The PKK struggle has broken the policy of denial and annihilation of our people and brought the Kurdish issue to a point of solving it through democratic politics.""

The PKK's decision will give President Tayyip Erdogan the opportunity to boost development in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast, where the insurgency has impaired the regional economy for decades.

A deputy leader of the pro-Kurdish DEM Party, the third largest in Turkey's parliament and which played a key role in facilitating Ocalan's peace call, told Reuters the PKK decision was significant not just for Kurdish people but for the Middle East as a whole.

""It will also necessitate a major shift in the official state mentality of Turkey,"" DEM's Tayip Temel said.

The announcement was welcome in the southeast's largest city Diyarbakir, where distrust of the government among many Kurds had eroded hopes that the peace process would be successful.

""It is really important that people do not die anymore, that the Kurdish problem is solved in a more democratic structure,"" said Hasan Huseyin Ceylan, 45, describing the PKK move as very important for both Kurdish and Turkish people.

Omer Celik, spokesperson for Erdogan's ruling AK Party, said the decision to dissolve was ""an important step toward a terror-free Turkey"".

Turkey's foreign ministry did not immediately comment on the announcement, which Ankara had been expecting.

The lira was mostly flat at 38.765 against the dollar while the main share index rose 3 percent.

                        Global perceptions of the United States have deteriorated across the world over the past year and are now worse than views of China, according to an annual study of perceptions of democracy published on Monday.

The survey did not go into details on the criteria used, but the Alliance of Democracies Foundation which commissioned it says its aim is to defend and advance democratic values.

When asked why perceptions of the US had slipped, Alliance founder and former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: ""President Trump has triggered a trade war, scolded Ukraine's president in the Oval Office, left allies feeling vulnerable and enemies emboldened.""

""It's no surprise that opinions have slipped even among people like me who spent their lives admiring the United States and what it stood for,"" he added.

Trump has said he is pushing for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine and on Thursday called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire between the two countries.

He has also said that tariffs are defending the US economy against what his administration sees as unfair trade conditions.

The conclusions in the Democracy Perception Index survey, conducted between April 9 and 23 with polling firm Nira Data, were based on more than 111,000 respondents worldwide, the Alliance said.

The perception of Trump was negative in 82 of the 100 countries surveyed, higher than Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who were viewed negatively in 61 and 44 countries, respectively.

The survey also ranked the perception of countries from -100% to +100%.

The net perception rating of the United States fell to -5% from +22% last year, indicating a greater number of respondents with a negative view of the country compared with those with a positive view.

The share of countries with a positive image of the US dropped to 45% from 76% last year, the survey showed.

For China, the net perception rose to +14% this year from +5% last year, the survey found.

India said it launched strikes on nine 'terrorist infrastructure' sites in Pakistan and Pakistani Kashmir on Wednesday, but Islamabad has said those were civilian sites.

 Philippines votes in high-stakes midterms amid Marcos-Duterte showdown ,"
                        
                        
                        Voting was underway in the Philippines on Monday for a normally low-key midterm election that is showcasing an emotionally charged proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and ally-turned-foe, Vice President Sara Duterte.

Duterte and Marcos are not on the ballot for more than 18,000 positions but have been campaigning aggressively for their slates of candidates, as their bitter rivalry dominates a contest that could influence the future dynamic of power in the country of 110 million people.

At stake for Marcos is his policy agenda, his legacy and influence over his succession in 2028, while Duterte's political survival could ride on the vote, with an impeachment trial looming that could kill any future hopes of becoming president and following in the footsteps of father Rodrigo Duterte. While posts for mayors, governors and lower house lawmakers are up for grabs, the tussle for Marcos and Duterte is over a dozen coveted seats in the 24-member Senate, a chamber with sweeping legislative influence and political clout that can shape public opinion and sink presidential ambitions.

Both Marcos and Duterte cast their votes early on Monday in their home towns. Duterte told reporters she had recently spoken with her father, who is detained in The Hague and facing trial at the International Criminal Court over his ""war on drugs"".

She said she told him that more than two of his 10 endorsed Senate candidates were likely to win. Among the 10 is the former police chief who oversaw the drugs war, during which thousands were killed.

""This election is more than an informal referendum on the Marcos administration,"" said Aries Arugay, a political science professor at the University of the Philippines.

""The Senate race is the key proxy battle ... Marcos needs to retain a majority, or supermajority, to push forward his legislative and economic agenda.""

Local media reported that voting, which runs from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m., was generally proceeding as expected, aside from some delays caused by glitches in the vote-counting machines.



ACRIMONIOUS FEUD

The election has a new significance after the collapse of the once formidable alliance between the Marcos and Duterte dynasties and the dramatic fall from grace of the popular Duterte family, which has accused the president of orchestrating a campaign to destroy the biggest challengers to his power.

What began as a united front that swept the 2022 election unravelled into an acrimonious feud, marked by a torrent of personal accusations and a bid to impeach Duterte on allegations she misused funds, amassed unexplained wealth and threatened the lives of the president, first lady and the house speaker.

The Senate race is critical, with its members to become jurors if an impeachment trial goes ahead, where Duterte faces removal from office and a lifetime ban. At least 16 votes - a two-thirds majority - are needed to convict her.

""Whatever happens with the impeachment, whether a guilty (verdict) or acquittal, I'm ready for whatever happens,"" Duterte said after casting her vote.

Fuelling the flames of an already charged race was Rodrigo Duterte's arrest by Philippine police in March at the request of the ICC. Sara Duterte has accused Marcos of selling out sovereignty in giving up a former president to a foreign court.

Despite his detention, Duterte is on Monday's ballot for mayor in his hometown.

Both Dutertes have denied wrongdoing and have challenged the cases against them.

Marcos has distanced himself from the impeachment and rejects allegations of a vendetta against the Duterte family.

He has touted economic gains and his defence of sovereignty, campaigning on his tough stand against Beijing's conduct in the South China Sea, with China emerging as a political lightning rod in the election.

                        Contenders for South Korea's presidency kicked off their campaigns on Monday, vowing to unify a deeply polarised society and spur economic growth while navigating trade negotiations with the United States.

Asia's fourth-largest economy will hold a snap presidential election on Jun 3 to choose Yoon Suk Yeol's successor after the conservative leader was ousted over his shock martial law order that plunged the country into a political crisis.

Surrounded by a huge crowd of supporters dressed in blue, frontrunner Lee Jae-myung from the liberal Democratic Party rallied in the centre of capital Seoul.

Some supporters danced to campaign songs while others chanted ""Lee Jae-myung, President!"".

""Will you join the journey to a new start, a new path to hope?"" Lee told the crowd, changing into a pair of sneakers onstage to signal his hard work during the race.

Lee, who lost the previous presidential polls to Yoon, is now riding a wave of popular support after overcoming a knife attack, standing up to the martial law order and contesting criminal charges that have threatened to disqualify him from the race.

His ongoing trials on matters ranging from bribery to charges mostly linked to a $1-billion property development scandal have been pushed back to after the polls.

Lee, wearing a bulletproof vest due to threats to his safety, promised to become the leader of unity and weather a trade crisis triggered by trade tariffs imposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.



His party's major policy proposals involve growing the economy with a focus on artificial intelligence and K-pop culture industries.

If elected, Lee would seek to restore soured relations with North Korea, which is technically at war with the South, while expanding the country's diplomatic sphere into Europe, according to the party's policy pledges.

Kim Moon-soo, Lee's conservative rival, began his campaign at a public wholesale market in Seoul, eating a Korean sausage soup with merchants and promising to revive small businesses in the slowing economy.

After a tumultuous week that required merging his campaign with a former Prime Minister who was also scheduled to run, the former labour minister has officially become the presidential candidate from the major right-wing People Power Party.

Yoon publicly endorsed Kim on Sunday to fight ""the giant opposition party"", but his support has garnered criticism from some PPP members who want the party to kick out the ousted leader.

Job creation and a business-friendly environment are Kim's key policy proposals. If elected, he has proposed an immediate summit meeting with Trump to negotiate tariffs.

Kim said he would focus on strengthening the security alliance with the United States but also seek a path for the country to potentially pursue nuclear armament by securing the right to reprocess nuclear fuel, a major step toward building atomic weapons.

 Trump to sign executive order to cut prices of medicine to match other countries ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would sign an executive order to cut prescription prices to the level paid by other high-income countries, an amount he put at 30% to 80% less.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would sign the executive order on Monday morning to pursue what is known as ""most favoured nation"" pricing or international reference pricing.

The US pays the most in the world for many prescription drugs, often nearly triple that of other developed nations. Trump has said he wants to close that spread, but has not publicly specified how and did not provide details in his post.

""They will rise throughout the World in order to equalise and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA!"" he said.

""I will be instituting a MOST FAVOURED NATION‚ÄôS POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,"" Trump added.

Drugmakers have been expecting an order that would focus on the Medicare health insurance program, according to four drug industry lobbyists who said they had been briefed by the White House. Reuters previously reported such a policy was under consideration.

The drugmakers expect the order to apply to a universe of drugs beyond those currently subject to negotiation under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

Because of that law, Medicare has negotiated prices for 10 drugs, with those prices due to be put in place next year. More medicines were set to be negotiated later this year.

""Government price setting in any form is bad for American patients,"" Alex Schriver, a spokesperson for the top US  drug company lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement when asked about Trump's planned executive order.

This is not the first time President Trump has tried to tie drug prices to what other countries pay. During Trump's first term, a court blocked a proposed international reference pricing program.

That proposal five years ago was projected by his administration to save taxpayers more than $85 billion over seven years, cutting into US  annual spending of more than $400 billion on drugs.

 Trump plans to accept luxury 747 from Qatar to use as Air Force One ,"
                        
                        
                        US  President Donald Trump's administration intends to accept a Boeing 747-8 plane as a gift from the Qatari royal family that would be outfitted to serve as Air Force One, according to a source briefed on the matter.

The luxury plane, which would be one of the most valuable gifts ever received by the US  government, would eventually be donated to Trump's presidential library after he leaves office, the source said. A new commercial 747-8 costs approximately $400 million.

In a post on his social media site Truth Social late on Sunday, Trump appeared to confirm the proposal.

""So the fact that the Defence Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,"" he wrote.

Democrats and good government advocates said it was unethical and likely unconstitutional for Qatar to make such a gift.

""Nothing says 'America First' like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X. ""It's not just bribery, it's premium foreign influence with extra legroom.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, ""Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump's administration is committed to full transparency.""

A Qatari spokesperson, Ali Al-Ansari, told the New York Times that the possible transfer of the aircraft was still under consideration and ""no decision has been made,"" the newspaper reported.

ABC News was first to report the planned gift on Sunday.

Trump has expressed frustration at the delays in delivering two new 747-8 aircraft to serve as an updated Air Force One. During his first term, Trump had reached a deal with Boeing to deliver the jets in 2024. A US  Air Force official told Congress last week that Boeing had proposed finishing the planes by 2027.

Trump toured the Qatari-owned 747-8 in February when it was parked at Palm Beach International Airport in Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago resort. At the time, the White House said the president did so to get a better understanding of how the updated Air Force One planes would be configured.

In a statement, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, a good government organisation based in Washington, questioned whether the transfer might violate the Constitution's ban on US  officials accepting gifts from foreign governments absent congressional approval.

""This sure looks like a foreign country that the president has personal business dealings in giving the president a $400 million gift right before he meets with their head of state,"" the spokesman, Jordan Libowitz, said.

Trump is set to visit Qatar during a trip to the Middle East this week. The airplane will not be presented or accepted while Trump is in Qatar.

ABC reported, citing sources, that lawyers for the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice had prepared an analysis concluding that it would be legal and constitutional for the Defence Department to accept the plane as a gift and later transfer it to Trump's presidential library.

 Zelensky tells Putin to come to Turkey if he wants talks ,"
                        
                        
                        Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to meet Vladimir Putin in Turkey on Thursday after US President Donald Trump told him publicly to immediately accept the Kremlin leader's proposal of direct talks.

Zelensky's suggestion of a meeting with Putin capped a dramatic 48 hours in which European leaders joined Zelensky in demanding a 30-day ceasefire from Monday, only for Putin to make a counter-proposal to instead hold the first direct Ukraine-Russia talks since the early months of the 2022 invasion.

It was far from clear, however, that Putin meant he would attend in person. Putin and Zelensky have not met since December 2019 and make no secret of their contempt for each other.

""I will be waiting for Putin in T√ºrkiye on Thursday. Personally,"" Zelensky wrote on X. ""I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.""

On Telegram, his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, added: ""What about Putin? Is he afraid? We'll see.""

The Ukrainian leader had responded guardedly earlier on Sunday after the Russian president, in a night-time televised statement that coincided with prime time in the US, proposed direct talks in Istanbul next Thursday, May 15.

Putin's suggestion came hours after major European powers demanded on Saturday in Kyiv that he agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face ""massive"" new sanctions, a position that Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg endorsed.

TRUMP DEMANDS TALKS BEGIN

Zelensky too had said Ukraine was ready for talks, if Moscow agreed to the 30-day ceasefire.

Yet Trump, who has the power to continue or sever Washington's crucial supply of arms to Ukraine, took a different line.

""President Putin of Russia doesn‚Äôt want to have a Cease Fire Agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey, to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly!""

Russia and Ukraine have both courted Trump.

Kyiv is desperate to unlock more of the US military backing it received from his predecessor, Joe Biden. Moscow senses an opportunity to get relief from a barrage of economic sanctions and engage with the world's biggest economy.

Putin sent Russia's armed forces into Ukraine in February 2022, unleashing a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers and triggered the gravest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

But with Russian forces grinding forward, the Kremlin chief has offered few, if any, concessions so far.

In his overnight address, he proposed what he said would be ""direct negotiations without any preconditions"".

But almost immediately, senior Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters the talks must take into account both an abandoned 2022 draft peace framework and the current situation on the ground.

This language is shorthand for Kyiv agreeing to permanent neutrality in return for a security guarantee and accepting that Russia controls swathes of Ukraine.

Ukraine says agreeing to the terms of the 2022 draft would be tantamount to capitulation.

PUTIN REJECTS 'ULTIMATUMS'

Putin dismissed what he said was an attempt to lay down ""ultimatums"" in the form of Western European and Ukrainian demands for a ceasefire starting on Monday. His foreign ministry spelled out that talks about the root causes of the conflict must precede discussions of a ceasefire.

Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker and has repeatedly promised to end the war, earlier responded to Putin's address by saying that this could be ""A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!"".

Though Russia did not commit to it, Zelensky said Ukraine's ceasefire plan for Monday still stood.

""We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,"" he wrote on X.

Speaking in his nightly address, Zelensky said he was still waiting for a response from the Russian side - and that Ukrainian forces would respond in kind if Russian troops did not observe a truce.

The US embassy in Kyiv issued a warning on Friday of a ""potentially significant"" Russian air attack in the coming days.

 Trump Tower Damascus? Syria seeks to charm US president for sanctions relief ,"
                        
                        
                        A Trump Tower in Damascus, a detente with Israel and US access to Syria's oil and gas are part of Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa's strategic pitch to try to get face time with US President Donald Trump during his trip to the Middle East, according to several sources familiar with the push to woo Washington.

Jonathan Bass, an American pro-Trump activist, who on April 30 met Sharaa for four hours in Damascus, along with Syrian activists and Gulf Arab states has been trying to arrange a landmark - if highly unlikely - meeting between the two leaders this week on the sidelines of Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Syria has struggled to implement conditions set out by Washington for relief from US sanctions, which keep the country cut off from the global financial system and make economic recovery extremely challenging after 14 years of grinding war.

Bass hopes that getting Trump into a room with Sharaa, who still remains a US-designated terrorist over his al-Qaeda past, could help soften the Republican President and his administration's thinking on Damascus and cool an increasingly tense relationship between Syria and Israel.

Part of the bet for the effort is based on Trump's history of breaking with longstanding US foreign policy taboos, such as when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea in 2019.

""Sharaa wants a business deal for the future of his country,"" Bass said, noting it could cover energy exploitation, cooperation against Iran and engagement with Israel.

""He told me he wants a Trump Tower in Damascus. He wants peace with his neighbours. What he told me is good for the region, good for Israel,"" said Bass.

Sharaa also shared what he saw as a personal connection with Trump: both have been shot at, narrowly surviving attempts on their lives, Bass said.

Syrian officials and a presidency media official did not respond to a request for comment.

Sharaa spoke with Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday, according to the Syrian presidency.

A person close to Sharaa said afterwards a Trump-Sharaa meeting remained possible in Saudi Arabia, but would not confirm whether Sharaa had received an invitation.

""Whether or not the meeting takes place won't be known until the last moment,"" the person said.



'PUSH UNDERWAY'

To be clear, a Trump-Sharaa meeting during the US president's visit to the region is widely seen as unlikely, given Trump's packed schedule, his priorities and lack of consensus within Trump's team on how to tackle Syria.

A source familiar with ongoing efforts said a high-level Syria-US meeting was set to take place in the region during the week of Trump's visit, but that it would not be between Trump and Sharaa.

""There is definitely a push underway,"" said Charles Lister, head of the Syria Initiative at the Middle East Institute.

""The idea is that getting to Trump directly is the best avenue because there are just too many ideologues within the administration to get past.""

Washington is yet to formulate and articulate a coherent Syria policy, but the administration has increasingly been viewing relations with Damascus from a perspective of counterterrorism, three sources including a US official familiar with the policy-making said.

That approach was illustrated by the make-up of the US delegation in a meeting last month between Washington and Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani in New York, which included a senior counterterrorism official from the State Department, two of the sources said.

US officials conveyed to Shibani that Washington found steps taken by Damascus to be insufficient, particularly on the US demand to remove foreign fighters from senior posts in the army and expel as many of them as possible, the sources said.

The US Treasury has since conveyed its own demands on the Syrian government, bringing the number of conditions to more than a dozen, one of the sources said.

The US State Department declined to disclose who attended the meeting from the US side and said it does not comment on private diplomatic discussions.

White House National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt said the actions of Syria's interim authorities would determine the future US support or possible sanctions relief.

'OLIVE BRANCH'

A key aim of Syria's overtures to Washington is communicating that it poses no threat to Israel, which has escalated airstrikes in Syria since the country's rebels-turned rulers ousted former strongman Bashar al-Assad last year.

Israel's ground forces have occupied territory in southwestern Syria while the government has lobbied the US to keep Syria decentralised and isolated.

Israel has said it aims to protect Syrian minority groups. Syria has rejected the strikes as escalatory.

Sharaa last week confirmed indirect negotiations with Israel aimed at calming tensions, after Reuters reported that such talks had occurred via the UAE.

In a separate effort, Bass said Sharaa told him to pass messages between Syria and Israel that may have led to a direct meeting between Israeli and Syrian officials.

But Israel soon resumed strikes, including one near the presidential palace, which it framed as a message to Syria's rulers to protect the country's Druze minority amid clashes with Sunni militants.

""Sharaa sent the Israelis an olive branch. Israel sent missiles,"" Bass said.

""We need Trump to help sort this relationship out.""

" US, China hail 'constructive' Geneva trade talks, details due Monday ","
                        
                        
                        The US and China ended high-stakes trade talks on a positive note on Sunday, with US officials touting a ""deal"" to reduce the US trade deficit, while Chinese officials said the sides had reached ""important consensus"" and agreed to launch another new economic dialogue forum.

Neither side released details after they wrapped up two days of talks in Switzerland. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said a joint statement would be released in Geneva on Monday. Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang said it would contain ""good news for the world.""

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described ""substantial progress"" and also said details would be announced on Monday.

In separate briefings with reporters, neither side mentioned any agreement to cut US tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods and China's 125% tariffs on US goods.

Greer and Bessent took no questions from reporters. The US Treasury chief has said previously that these duties amount to a trade embargo between the world's two largest economies and need to be ""de-escalated.""

Financial markets have been on edge for signs of a thaw in a bitter US-China trade war that has already begun to disrupt supply chains, prompt layoffs and raise wholesale prices.

Greer described the Geneva meetings' conclusion as ""a deal we struck with our Chinese partners"" that will help reduce the $1.2 trillion US global goods trade deficit.

""And this was, as the secretary pointed out, a very constructive two days,"" Greer said. ""It's important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,"" Greer said.

The US trade chief called He, Li and Vice Finance Minister Liao Min ""tough negotiators.""

Vice Premier He, speaking to reporters at China's mission to World Trade Organization, described the talks as ""candid, in-depth and constructive"" on issues of concern to both countries.

""The meeting achieved substantial progress, and reached important consensus,"" He said, drawing applause from a large audience of Chinese officials present at the WTO office.

He also met with WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who said she was ""pleased with the positive outcome"" of the talks and urged the two countries to build on momentum to mitigate trade tensions.

The WTO has ruled against Trump's past tariffs on Chinese goods, but the cases have been stalled in the WTO's paralysed appellate body due to the US blocking judge appointments.

NEW CONSULTATION PLATFORM

The US and China agreed to establish a new consultation mechanism for trade and economic issues, with relevant details to be finalized as soon as possible, He added.

China and the US have convened numerous consultation bodies to try to resolve trade and economic differences in recent decades, including the Economic Working Group that former president Joe Biden's Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, established with Vice Premier He in 2023.

These dialogues have provided forums for airing bilateral grievances, but have done little to advance Washington's longstanding goal to shift China's state dominated, export-driven economic model toward one driven by consumer spending.

FIRST MEETING

The meeting was the first face-to-face interaction between senior US and Chinese economic officials since Trump took office and launched a global tariff blitz, declaring a national emergency over the US fentanyl crisis and imposing a 20% tariff on Chinese goods in February.

Trump followed with a 34% ""reciprocal"" duty on Chinese imports in April, and subsequent rounds pushed the rates into triple digits, bringing nearly $600 billion in two-way trade to a standstill.

China had insisted that tariffs be lowered in any talks. Trump said on Friday that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods ""seems right,"" suggesting for the first time a specific reduction target.

Greer said there was a lot of groundwork done before the Geneva meetings on Saturday and Sunday, and that the result would address the national emergency that Trump declared over growing US trade deficits.

""We‚Äôre confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency,"" Greer said.

A White House press release that simply repeated Bessent's and Greer's brief comments with no details ran the headline: ""US announces China trade deal in Geneva.""

MORE TARIFF DEALS

Earlier on Sunday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the Chinese were ""very, very eager"" to engage in discussions and rebalance trade relations with the US.

Hassett also told Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures program that more foreign trade deals could be coming with other countries as soon as this week. Last week's limited trade deal with Britain left 10% US duties in place on many UK products.

Hassett said he had been briefed by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on two dozen pending deals in development with USTR Greer.

""They all look a little bit like the UK deal but each one is bespoke,"" Hassett said.

Overnight, Trump gave a positive reading of the talks, saying on his Truth Social media platform that the two sides had negotiated ""a total reset... in a friendly, but constructive, manner.""

GATED VILLA

The teams met at the gated villa of Switzerland's UN ambassador, overlooking Lake Geneva in the leafy suburb of Cologny. Black Mercedes vans with sirens shuttled to and from the venue, bathed in bright sunshine.

Neutral Switzerland was chosen as the venue following approaches by Swiss politicians on recent visits to China and the US.

Washington is seeking to reduce its $295 billion goods trade deficit with Beijing and persuade China to renounce what Washington calls a mercantilist economic model, a shift that would require politically sensitive domestic reforms.

                        Fresh talks between Iranian and US negotiators to resolve disputes over Tehran's nuclear programme ended in Oman on Sunday with further negotiations planned, officials said, as Tehran insisted in public on continuing uranium enrichment.

Though Tehran and Washington both have said they prefer diplomacy to resolve the decades-long nuclear dispute, they remain deeply divided on several red lines that negotiators will have to circumvent to reach a new nuclear deal and avert future military action.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said the latest round of ""indirect talks were difficult but useful to better understand each other's positions"".

In a post on the X platform, he added that the time and venue of the next round of negotiations would be announced by Muscat.

A senior official from President Donald Trump's administration said Sunday's ""direct and indirect"" discussions had lasted more than three hours.

""We are encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future,"" the official said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff held the fourth round of talks in Muscat through Omani mediators, despite Washington taking a tough stance in public that Iranian officials said would not help the negotiations.

On Thursday, Witkoff told Breitbart News that Washington's red line is: ""No enrichment. That means dismantlement, no weaponization,"" requiring the complete dismantling of Iran's nuclear facilities in Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan.

""If they are not productive on Sunday, then they won't continue and we'll have to take a different route,"" Witkoff said about the talks.

TRUMP'S MIDDLE EAST VISIT

The fourth round of talks took place ahead of Trump's Middle East visit. Trump, who has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails, has restored a ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Tehran since returning to the White House in January.

Reacting to Witkoff's comments, Araqchi said on Sunday Iran would not compromise on its nuclear rights, which include uranium enrichment.

Tehran is willing to negotiate some curbs on its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions, according to Iranian officials, but ending its enrichment programme or surrendering its enriched uranium stockpile are among ""Iran's red lines that could not be compromised"" in the talks.

A senior Iranian official close to the negotiating team said that U.S. demands for ""zero enrichment and dismantling Iran's nuclear sites would not help in progressing the negotiations"".

""What the US says publicly differs from what is said in negotiations,"" the official said, on condition of anonymity.

Moreover, Iran has flatly ruled out negotiating its ballistic missile programme and the clerical establishment demands watertight guarantees Trump would not again ditch a nuclear pact.

Trump exited Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers in 2018 during his first term and reimposed tough sanctions that have devastated Iran's economy.

Iran, which has long said its nuclear programme is peaceful, has breached the 2015 pact's nuclear curbs since 2019, including ""dramatically"" accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60 percent purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons-grade, according to the UN nuclear watchdog.

 Prospects of Saudi ties to Israel elusive as Trump seeks $1 trillion bonanza ,"
                        
                        
                        When US President Donald Trump lands in Riyadh on Tuesday, he will be greeted with opulent ceremonies, gilded palaces and the prospect of $1 trillion in investments. But the raging war in Gaza has denied him one goal he has long craved: Saudi-Israel normalisation.

Behind the scenes, US officials are quietly pressing Israel to agree to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza - one of Saudi Arabia's preconditions for any re-start of normalisation talks, said a US official and two Gulf sources close to official circles.

Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told an audience at the Israeli embassy in Washington this week that he imminently expected progress on expanding the Abraham Accords, a set of deals brokered by Trump in his first term under which Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco recognised Israel.

‚ÄúWe think we will have some or a lot of announcements very, very shortly, which we hope will yield progress by next year,‚Äù Witkoff said in a video of his speech. He is expected to accompany Trump on his visit to the Middle East.

However, opposition by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war or to the creation of a Palestinian state make progress on similar talks with Riyadh unlikely, two of the sources said.

Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel as legitimate, meaning the Middle East's two most advanced economies and military powers do not have formal diplomatic ties. Supporters of normalising relations say it would bring stability and prosperity to the region, while countering Iran's influence.

For Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and custodian of its two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, the question of establishing formal relations is far more than just a diplomatic milestone. It is a deeply sensitive national security issue.

Even if Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is open to normalisation, the timing is politically explosive, according to two Saudi sources familiar with the matter.

Without ending the Gaza war and laying out a credible roadmap to Palestinian statehood, normalisation risks inflaming public outrage and emboldening groups such as al-Qaeda, Islamic State, and the Houthis, who have already weaponised the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to justify attacks across the region.

As such, the issue, central to bilateral talks in Trump's first term, has effectively been delinked from economic and other security matters between Washington and the kingdom, according to six sources Reuters spoke with for this story, including the two Saudi and two other US officials. The people all asked to remain anonymous to speak about sensitive diplomatic conversations.

The crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, needs the Gaza war to end and a credible path to a Palestinian state ""before he re-engages with the issue of normalization,"" said Dennis Ross, a former US negotiator.

In the meantime, Washington and Riyadh will focus Trump's trip largely on the economic partnership and other regional matters, according to the six sources. Lucrative investments such as major deals in arms, mega-projects and artificial intelligence are in play, officials from both sides stressed.

The approach was cemented in diplomatic talks between Saudi and US officials ahead of the trip, the first formal state visit of Trump's second term, they said.

Trump's stated aim is to secure a trillion-dollar investment in US companies, building on an initial commitment of $600 billion pledged by the crown prince.

The wealthy kingdom, the world's top oil exporter, knows the ritual well: dazzle the guest, secure the favor. The goal, the sources told Reuters, is to evade diplomatic landmines and perhaps, one said, to win concessions from Trump on the Gaza war and its aftermath.

""The Trump administration wants this trip to be a big deal. That means lots of splashy deal announcements and collaborations that can be sold as being good for America,"" said Robert Mogielnicki, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, a think tank in Washington.

""Normalizing ties with Israel is a much heavier lift than rolling out the red carpet for President Trump and announcing investment deals,‚Äù he said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on any understanding reached ahead of the trip, saying Trump ""will look to strengthen ties between the United States and our Arab Gulf partners during the visits.""

The Saudi government communications office did not reply to a request for comment.

COURTING THE KINGDOM

Before Hamas launched its October 7 attacks on Israel - killing 1,200 people and sparking the devastating Israeli offensive into Gaza - the crown prince was finalising a landmark diplomatic agreement: a US defence pact in exchange for Riyadh recognising Israel.

But the scale of Israel‚Äôs campaign, killing 52,000 people and displacing 1.9 million in Gaza, forced a pause in the talks. Bin Salman accused Israel of genocide.

Frustrated by the impact of Gaza's prolonged crisis on normalization efforts, Trump could use his visit to unveil a US framework to end the 18-month war, the two Gulf sources said.

The plan could create a transitional government and new security arrangements for post-war Gaza - potentially reshaping regional diplomacy and opening the door to future normalization talks, they said.

Underscoring the high-stakes diplomacy underway, Trump met privately with Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer on Thursday to discuss the war and nuclear talks with Iran, Axios reported.

The US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about Trump's discussions on Gaza.

Trump conspicuously has not announced a visit to Israel as part of his tour of the region. Two diplomats noted the US president has recently refrained from talking about his ""Gaza Riviera"" plan that enraged the Arab world with the suggestion of resettling the entire Gazan population and US ownership of the strip.

In the build up to the trip, Washington has taken a number of actions that are positive for Saudi Arabia. An agreement to stop US bombing of the Houthis in Yemen is in line with a Saudi ceasefire there. Washington has also delinked civil nuclear talks from the normalisation question.

The stalled Saudi-US defence pact, initially conceived as a formal treaty, was revived in the scaled back form of security guarantees late in the Biden presidency to bypass congressional opposition.

The Trump administration has now picked up those talks, along with the discussions about a civilian nuclear agreement, three of the sources said, while cautioning that it will take time to define terms.

CHINA INFLUENCE

Trump's Saudi trip is his first formal state visit and second foreign trip since his re-election, after attending the pope's funeral in Rome. He will also visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Beneath the showmanship of Trump's visits, diplomats say, lie also a calculated US effort to reassert influence and reshape economic alignments in a region where Beijing - Washington's chief economic rival - has steadily expanded its foothold at the heart of the petrodollar system.

Trump‚Äôs first trip abroad in his first term also began in Riyadh, where he unveiled $350 billion in Saudi investments.

Trump commands deep trust from the Saudi leadership, rooted in the close ties during his first term - a period defined by large arms deals and steadfast US backing for Bin Salman, even as global outrage erupted over the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.

Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies now plan to urge Trump to ease US regulations that have increasingly deterred foreign investment, particularly in sectors deemed part of America‚Äôs ‚Äúcritical national infrastructure,‚Äù five industry sources said.

In meetings with US officials, Saudi ministers will advocate for a more business-friendly climate, especially at a time when China is aggressively courting Gulf capital, the industry sources said.

While countering China‚Äôs economic rise may top Trump‚Äôs foreign policy agenda, it won't be easy in Saudi Arabia. Since the launch of Vision 2030, China has become integral to the kingdom's plans, dominating sectors from energy and infrastructure to renewables.

 Villagers evacuated from line of fire along India-Pakistan border fear going back ,"
                        
                        
                        After spending days in temporary homes and with relatives, people from both sides of the Indian and Pakistani border are sceptical about this weekend's ceasefire and in no hurry to return to their villages.

Indian cites like Jammu and Amritsar, which were spooked by the sounds of explosions after the truce was agreed, remained quieter than normal on Sunday with many shops choosing to close and people preferring to stay indoors.

Indian and Pakistani authorities advised people who had left border areas not to return to frontline villages just yet.

After four days of fighting, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday under US pressure, but within hours explosions rang out in border towns and India accused Pakistan of violating the pact.

The arch rivals had been involved in the worst fighting in nearly three decades, firing missiles and drones at each other's military installations and killing almost 70 people.

""URGENT APPEAL: Do not return to frontline villages. Lives are at risk. Unexploded munitions remain after Pakistani shelling,"" said a police notice in Indian Kashmir.

Hundreds of people were shifted to temporary homes, while others left to stay with relatives far from the border as fighting intensified earlier in the week.

""I want to go back to my village in Bihar. Do not want to go back there (to the border) and die,"" said Asha Devi, a 22-year- old farm labourer in the Akhnoor region, one of the areas worst affected by shelling in recent days.

Kabal Singh, head of a village close to the border, said people were scared to return home after they heard the blasts following the ceasefire announcement.

On the Pakistan side of the border, some residents displaced from villages were advised to wait until Monday midday before returning.

                        Pope Leo XIV appealed to the world's major powers for ""no more war"" in his first Sunday message to crowds in St Peter's Square since his election as pontiff.

The new pope, elected on May 8, called for an ""authentic and lasting peace"" in Ukraine, a ceasefire in Gaza, and the release of all Israeli hostages held by militant group Hamas.

Speaking in fluent Italian, Leo also welcomed the recent fragile ceasefire between India and Pakistan, negotiated overnight, and said he was praying to God to grant the world the ""miracle of peace.""


""No more war!"" the pope said, repeating a frequent call of the late Pope Francis and noting the recent 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, in which some 60 million people were killed.

Leo said today's world was living through ""the dramatic scenario of a Third World War being fought piecemeal,"" again repeating a phrase coined by Francis.

Tens of thousands of people in St Peter's Square and on the Via della Conciliazione leading to the Vatican broke into applause at the call for peace on what was a joyous occasion despite Leo's solemn message.

The new pope said he carries in his heart the ""suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine.""

Hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed direct talks with Ukraine aimed at ending the bloody three-year war, Leo appealed for negotiations to reach an ""authentic, just and lasting peace"".

The pope also said he was ""profoundly saddened"" by the war in Gaza, calling for an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid and release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.

Leo said he was glad to hear of the recent India-Pakistan ceasefire and hoped negotiations would lead to a lasting accord between the nuclear-armed neighbors.

He added: ""But there are so many other conflicts in the world!""

MARCHING BANDS

Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, is the first US-born pontiff and was a relative unknown on the world stage before his election.

He previously served for decades as a missionary in Peru before first becoming a cardinal to take up a senior Vatican role two years ago.

Leo's first Sunday address coincided with a previously planned pilgrimage to Rome by marching bands from around the world.

Minutes before the pope addressed the crowd, bands marched up the broad boulevard leading to the Vatican playing songs such as YMCA by the Village People, the theme from the film Rocky, and music by John Philip Sousa, who composed the marching classic ""Stars and Stripes Forever"".

Peruvian Gladys Ruiz, who lives in Rome, was among the crowd in the square, estimated at more than 100,000 by Italian authorities. Calling Leo a ""Peruvian pope"" Ruiz said his election is ""a great honour for us"". Leo has dual citizenship, having gained Peruvian citizenship in 2015.

Also present were Dennis Gilligan and wife Maureen from Boston, Massachusetts, visiting Rome for their anniversary. He said he had passed up an opportunity to see Pope John Paul II when he visited Boston in 1979.

""I regretted it all my life,"" he said. ""This was very moving.""

The crowd was also entertained by bands from Italy, Mexico and other parts of Latin America who came to Rome for the ongoing Catholic Holy Year.

In all of his appearances since his election, Leo has not made any mention of the country of his birth, angering some US conservative commentators.

""I do not believe that this conflict can be permanently resolved by military means,"" Wadephul said. ""Nevertheless, it is urgently necessary that Hamas is disarmed and that it can no longer have military control over Gaza.""

He said that Germany would do whatever it takes to guarantee Israel's security, but this does not mean that his country cannot criticise Israel's course of action, adding that this ""must not lead to antisemitism.""

Hamas' attacks on Oct 7, 2023 killed 1,200 people and 251 were taken hostage back to Gaza, according to Israel. Israel's campaign has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Hamas-run health authorities.

""I am not sure whether all of Israel's strategic goals can be achieved in this way (through a military campaign) and whether this will serve Israel's security in the long term,"" Wadephul said. ""That is why we are appealing for a return to serious negotiations on a ceasefire.""

Wadephul repeated that the return of hostages is the German government's priority. He also said it was clear that Gaza is part of the Palestinian territory.

 Zelensky cautious after Putin proposes direct peace talks with Ukraine ,"
                        
                        
                        Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded guardedly on Sunday to a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin of rapid direct talks aimed at ending the war, saying Kyiv was willing to talk but only after Moscow agreed to a ceasefire.

Putin made his proposal in a 1:30am (2230 GMT Saturday) televised statement from the Kremlin that coincided with prime time in the US, where President Donald Trump has been pressing both sides to agree to a truce of at least 30 days and stop the three-year-old war.

Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker and has repeatedly promised to end the war, called it ""A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!""

However, Putin suggested that any ceasefire was a matter for the talks he proposed for Istanbul next Thursday, May 15.

And minutes later, senior Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters the talks must take into account both an abandoned 2022 draft peace deal and the current situation on the ground - shorthand for Kyiv agreeing to permanent neutrality in return for a security guarantee and accepting that Russia controls swathes of Ukraine.

Putin sent Russia's armed forces into Ukraine in February 2022, unleashing a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of soldiers and triggered the gravest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

With Russian forces grinding forward, the Kremlin chief has offered few, if any, concessions so far.

He proposed what he said would be ""direct negotiations without any preconditions"", making no mention of the terms later set out by Ushakov.

Putin said he did not rule out both sides agreeing in Turkey on ""some new truces, a new ceasefire"" - but one that would be the first step towards a ""sustainable"" peace.

Zelensky said it was ""a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war"" but that ""the very first step in truly ending any war is a ceasefire.""

""We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire ‚Äì full, lasting, and reliable ‚Äì starting tomorrow, May 12, and Ukraine is ready to meet,"" he said.

TRUMP HOPES FOR 'BLOODBATH' TO END

For his part, Trump added, in his post on Truth Social: ""Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending 'bloodbath' hopefully comes to an end.""

Putin's proposal came hours after major European powers demanded on Saturday in Kyiv that Putin agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face ""massive"" new sanctions.

Putin dismissed what he said was an attempt to lay down ""ultimatums"", and his foreign ministry spelled out that talks about the root causes of the conflict must precede discussions of a ceasefire.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Putin's proposal for talks showed that he was looking for a way forward, but also trying to buy time.

""It's a first step but it's not enough,"" Macron told reporters on his way back from Ukraine early on Sunday. ""An unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations.""

Putin said Russia had proposed several ceasefires, including a moratorium on striking energy facilities, an Easter truce and most recently a 72-hour truce during celebrations marking 80 years since Soviet victory in World War Two.

None of these were agreed between the two sides, and each accused the other of continuing to attack in force during the supposed truce periods.

""Our proposal, as they say, is on the table,"" Putin said. ""The decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their 'curators', who are guided, it seems, by their personal political ambitions, and not by the interests of their peoples.""

The Kremlin said Erdogan had told Putin in a call that he ""fully supported"" Putin's proposal and was ready to host the talks in Istanbul.

Meanwhile Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine, injuring one person in the region surrounding the Ukrainian capital and damaging private homes, Ukrainian officials said.

PUTIN HAS STUCK TO RUSSIA'S CONDITIONS

Putin, whose forces control one-fifth of Ukraine and are advancing, has stood firm in his conditions for ending the war despite public and private pressure from Trump and repeated warnings from European powers.

Trump has publicly shown irritation with both sides. But more recently, since signing a deal to share the proceeds of Ukrainian mineral mining, he has appeared more frustrated with Moscow.

His Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, issued a socal media post suggesting this remained the case: ""As President Trump has repeatedly said, stop the killing!! An unconditional 30 day ceasefire first and, during it, move into comprehensive peace discussions. Not the other way around.""

In June 2024, Putin said Ukraine must officially drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed by Moscow. Russia considers Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, now irrevocably part of its own territory.

On Sunday, Putin mentioned the 2022 draft deallater cited by Ushakov.

Under that draft, a copy of which Reuters has reviewed, Ukraine would have agreed to permanent neutrality in return for international security guarantees from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.

""It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv,"" Putin said.

Former US president Joe Biden, Western European leaders and Ukraine have cast the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and repeatedly vowed to defeat Russian forces.

Putin presents the war as a watershed moment in Moscow's relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.

" Fragile ceasefire holds between India, Pakistan as Trump offers more help ","
                        
                        
                        
A fragile ceasefire was holding between India and Pakistan on Sunday, after hours of overnight fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as US President Donald Trump said he will work to provide a solution regarding Kashmir.

The arch rivals were locked in intense fighting for four days, the worst in nearly three decades, firing missiles and drones at each other's military installations, killing almost 70 people in all in the two countries.

A ceasefire agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the United States, but within hours, artillery fire was witnessed in Indian Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting.

Blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under a blackout, similar to the previous two evenings, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses.

Late on Saturday, India said Pakistan had violated the understanding to stop firing and that the Indian armed forces had been instructed to ""deal strongly"" with any repetition.

In response, Pakistan said it was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations.

The fighting and explosions died down by dawn, according to Reuters witnesses, and power was restored in most border areas in India after a blackout on Saturday night.

Trump praised leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression and said he would ""substantially"" increase trade with them, although this was ""not even discussed"".

""I will work with you both to see if ... a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,"" he said in a post on Truth Social.

Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan each rule a part of Kashmir but claim it in full, and have twice gone to war over the region.

India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of the territory, but Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.

Pakistan's foreign ministry welcomed Trump's statement on Sunday and added that ""any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute ... must ensure the realisation of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination.""

PICKING UP THE PIECES

Among those most affected by the fighting were residents in border areas on either side, many who fled their homes when the fighting began on Wednesday, two weeks after a deadly attack in Indian Kashmir's Pahalgam that India said was backed by Islamabad and which sparked the current round of fighting.

Pakistan denied the accusation.

In the Indian border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, a siren sounded on Sunday morning to resume normal activities brought relief from the tension and people were seen out on the roads.

""Ever since the terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam, we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty. I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides,"" Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in Amritsar told Reuters.

In some border areas, however, people were asked not to return just yet. In the Indian Kashmir city of Baramulla, residents were told to wait due to the threat posed by unexploded munitions.

""People here are hosting us well but just as a bird feels at peace in its own nest, we also feel comfortable only in our own homes, even if they have been damaged,"" said Azam Chaudhry, 55, who fled his home in the Pakistani town of Khuiratta and has now been told to wait until Monday before returning.

In Indian Kashmir's Uri, a key power plant that was damaged in a Pakistani drone attack is still under repair.

""The project has suffered minor damage ... We have stopped generation as the transmission line has been damaged,"" said an official from state-run NHPC, India's biggest hydropower company, who did not want to be identified.

Officials from the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Even with the ceasefire in place, the Indian Air Force said in a mid-day post on X unidentified ""operations"" were still ""ongoing"", while officials in Pakistan said around the same time there was some firing in Pakistani Kashmir's Bhimber overnight but nowhere else, and there were no casualties.

""More than me, my family is happy (with the ceasefire)...my children and wife have been calling me every hour to check on me,"" Guruman Singh, a security guard in Amritsar, said.

 Wounded Ukrainian soldiers ask: What ceasefire? ,"
                        
                        
                        Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared a three-day pause in fighting against Ukraine, but for bloodied Ukrainian soldiers limping into a field hospital, their wounds testified that the ceasefire was not being respected.

One soldier, who gave his name as Stanislav, sat in the field hospital on Friday night cradling his left arm. It was wrapped in gauze bandage, and blood was soaking through.

‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been any ceasefire,"" said Stanislav, who did not give his full name in line with Ukrainian military protocol.

""Shelling has continued just as before, drones are flying just like before, the same with explosives being dropped. Nothing has changed at all.""

""Look, we were driving today, there were mortars all the way. Advance parties moved forward, they tried to attack.""

Putin announced the three-day ceasefire to coincide with a May 9 military parade on Moscow's Red Square where he hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders in commemoration of the end of World War Two.

The ceasefire is due to end at midnight (2100 GMT) on Saturday.

Ukraine did not sign up for the ceasefire, calling it a ruse by Putin. Each side has accused the other of carrying on fighting regardless, though there has been a pause in long-range attacks on each other's capitals.

Reuters was given access to the field hospital, in the Zaporizhzhia region of southern Ukraine that is partially controlled by Russian forces, on condition the news agency did not disclose the exact location.

Medics examined soldiers as they came in and replaced the dressings that had been hurriedly put on their wounds out in the field. The more serious cases were placed on a gurney while medics bandaged them, checked their vital signs, and cleaned dried blood and mud off their skin.

One of the medics, who gave his name as Oleh, said it was a regular night's work, even with the Russian-declared ceasefire.

‚ÄúThe same as usual, we got used to it. They will never change,"" he said of the Russian forces.

""Just the opposite, we know that if they declare some sort of ceasefire it will be exactly the opposite. No question about that. They keep shooting.""

 First white South Africans to arrive under US refugee plan as soon as next week ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump's administration is aiming to bring the first group of white South Africans to the United States via its refugee programme as soon as next week, three people familiar with the matter said, a divisive effort given that Trump has been blocking refugee admissions from the rest of the world.

The Trump administration aims to fly the initial cohort of about 50 Afrikaners into Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, two of the people said, requesting anonymity to share internal plans. The group would participate in a press conference at the airport and then board flights to their US destinations, the sources said.

The sources cautioned that their arrival had already been delayed a week and that the plans could change. As of Thursday afternoon, a charter plane intended to ferry them to the US had not secured a landing permit, one source said.

The US State Department, which administers the resettlement of South Africans whom the Trump administration granted refugee status, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NPR first reported the timing of the arrivals.

Trump kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office in January, including an indefinite suspension of refugee resettlement. In a related executive order, the Republican president said the US would only admit refugees who ""can fully and appropriately assimilate.""

Despite the broad refugee freeze, Trump in February called on the US to prioritise resettling Afrikaners, descendants of mostly Dutch early settlers, saying they were ""victims of unjust racial discrimination.""

The assertion that minority white South Africans face discrimination from the Black majority has spread in far-right circles for years and been echoed by Trump's white South African-born ally Elon Musk.

The average white household in South Africa owns 20 times the wealth of the average Black household, according to the Review of Political Economy, an international academic journal.

In interviews with US immigration officers, white South Africans seeking refugee status have highlighted troubles with land disputes, crime and perceived racism, Reuters reported in April.

The South African government has criticized the Trump effort, saying it fails to recognise the country's history of colonialism and apartheid.

""It is most regrettable that it appears that the resettlement of South Africans to the United States under the guise of being 'refugees' is entirely politically motivated and designed to question South Africa‚Äôs constitutional democracy,"" South Africa's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement on Friday.

Stephen Miller, a top White House official and the architect of Trump's immigration agenda, defended the program while speaking to reporters, saying the situation ""fits the textbook definition"" of race-based persecution.

While some Afrikaners have expressed interest in moving to politically conservative US states, Democratic-leaning Minnesota has emerged as a popular choice, two of the sources told Reuters.

Minnesota has a reputation as a welcoming state for refugees, including those from Somalia, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Some also plan to head to Republican-leaning states, such as Idaho and Alabama, one of the sources said.

The reason to charter a flight for the initial group of Afrikaners was not immediately clear. The charter plane would cost far more than commercial tickets, sources said.

 Putin proposes direct peace talks with Ukraine after three years of war ,"
                        
                        
                        Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday proposed direct talks with Ukraine on May 15 in Istanbul that he said should be aimed at bringing a durable peace and eliminating the root causes of the war.

Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, unleashing a war that has left hundreds of thousands of soldiers dead and triggering the gravest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

He said Russia was proposing direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul in an attempt to ""eliminate the root causes of the conflict"" and ""to achieve the restoration of a long-term, lasting peace"" rather than simply a pause for rearmament.

""We are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,"" Putin said from the Kremlin in the early hours of Sunday. ""We offer the Kyiv authorities to resume negotiations already on Thursday, in Istanbul.""

Despite public and private pressure from US President Donald Trump and repeated warnings from European powers, Putin has offered few concessions towards ending the conflict.

Putin said that he would speak to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan later on Sunday about facilitating the talks, which he said could lead to a ceasefire.

""Our proposal, as they say, is on the table, the decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their curators, who are guided, it seems, by their personal political ambitions, and not by the interests of their peoples.""

There was no immediate response from Kyiv to the proposal, which came in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Russia, Putin said, had proposed several ceasefires, including a moratorium on striking energy facilities, an Easter ceasefire and most recently the 72-hour truce during the celebrations marking 80 years since victory in World War Two but accused Ukraine of repeatedly violating the ceasefires.

He said that during the May ceasefire Ukraine had attacked Russia with 524 aerial drones, 45 sea drones, a number of Western missiles and that Russia had repelled five attacks on Russian regions.

Ukraine has accused Russia of repeatedly violating its own ceasefire, and along with major European powers, demanded on Saturday that Putin agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face ""massive"" new sanctions.

Putin dismissed what he said was the attempt by some European powers to slap down ""ultimatums"".

PEACE?

Putin, whose forces have advanced over the past year, has stood firm in his conditions for ending the war.

In June 2024, he said that Ukraine must officially drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed by Russia.

Russian officials have also proposed that the United States recognise Russia's control over about one fifth of Ukraine and demanded that Ukraine remains neutral though Moscow has said it is not opposed to Kyiv's ambitions to join the European Union.

Putin specifically mentioned the 2022 draft deal which Russia and Ukraine negotiated shortly after the Russian invasion of February 2022.

Under that draft, a copy of which Reuters has seen, Ukraine should agree to permanent neutrality in return for international security guarantees from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.

""It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv,"" Putin said. ""Russia is ready to negotiate without any preconditions.""

He thanked China, Brazil, African and Middle Eastern countries and the United States for their efforts to mediate.

Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly said he wants to end the ""bloodbath"" of the Ukraine war which his administration casts as a proxy war between the United States and Russia.

Former US President Joe Biden, Western European leaders and Ukraine cast the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and repeatedly vowed to defeat Russian forces.

" Iran to send Russia launchers for short-range missiles, sources say ","
                        
                        
                        Iran is preparing to deliver in the near future launchers for short-range ballistic missiles that the US said Tehran sent to Russia last year for use against Ukraine, according to two Western security officials and a regional official.

Iran denied it had such plans and dismissed the idea as ""utterly absurd"".

The delivery of the Fath-360 launchers - if it occurs - would help support Russia's grinding assault on its neighbor and reaffirm the deepening security ties between Moscow and Tehran.

With a 75-mile (120-km) range, the Fath-360 would give Moscow's forces a new weapon to fire at Ukrainian frontline troops, nearby military targets, and population centers close to the border with Russia, analysts said.

The US last September said that Iran delivered the missiles to Russia on nine Russian-flagged ships - which it sanctioned - and three sources told Reuters at that time that the launchers were not included.

The Western security officials and the regional official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the delivery of the Fath-360 launchers was imminent.

They declined to provide further details of the pending transfer, including why they thought the launchers were not delivered with the missiles.

Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations dismissed what it called ""baseless allegations"" against Tehran.

""So long as conflict persists between the parties, Iran will abstain from rendering any form of military assistance to either side,"" it said in an emailed statement.

Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The US National Security Council referred inquiries to the State Department, which did not respond immediately. The CIA declined comment.

Russia and Iran have previously denied that Tehran had shipped the missiles or any other arms to aid the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Moscow launched in February 2022. US, Ukrainian and European officials say Iran has provided Russia thousands of drones and artillery shells.

In an apparent reference to the Fath-360s, US Army General Christopher Cavoli, the commander of US Central Command, last month told US lawmakers that Iran had donated to Russia more than 400 short-range ballistic missiles.

There have been no public reports of Iran transferring any other kinds of short-range ballistic missiles to Moscow or of Russian forces using the Fath-360.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATION FOR PEACE TALKS

Russia's deployment of the missiles could complicate US President Donald Trump's efforts to arrange a ceasefire and peace talks between Ukraine and Russia and to strike a separate deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program.

The regional official said that the indirect US-Iran nuclear talks mediated by Oman are among ""several reasons"" for the delayed delivery of the launchers.

The talks have encountered turbulence, although Iran on Friday said it agreed to hold a fourth round in Oman on Sunday.

Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said that Iranian officials would consider the issue of sending arms to Russia as separate from the nuclear talks.

""That the Iranians are negotiating on nuclear issues with the US will not be seen as connected to what they might do in collaboration with the Russians,"" he said.

Analysts said there could have been another complication: Iran had to modify European-made commercial trucks on which to mount the launchers for its own Fath-360 arsenal, and it may have had to do the same for Russia given its massive losses of vehicles in Ukraine.

With the launchers, Russia will be able to increase pressure on Ukraine, said the experts.

""It would be much easier (for Russian forces) to launch a strike much faster ... against high-value targets,"" said Fabian Hinz, a research fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ""They (Fath-360s) don't need a lot of launch preparations. Their flight time is incredibly short.""

Deploying the Fath-360 could allow Russia to reserve its more advanced missiles, like the Iskander, for longer-range strikes at critical infrastructure, including the power grid, straining Ukraine's precious missile defenses, the analysts said.

The Fath-360 ""is designed to be handled and operated by people with relatively little training,"" said Ralph Savelsberg, an associate professor at the Netherlands Defense Academy.

""Why would they (Russia) buy inferior Iranian missiles? The only reason I could think of is that they cannot produce a sufficient number of their own missiles,"" he said.

""They're not super accurate and they don't carry a very large payload. But it just adds to Ukraine's headaches.""

                        A key water-sharing pact between India and Pakistan remains suspended, four government sources told Reuters, despite the countries reaching a ceasefire agreement on Saturday after days of deadly fighting.

The Indus Waters Treaty, mediated by the World Bank in 1960, regulates the division of water from the Indus River and its tributaries between the South Asian nations.

India pulled out of it last month after a deadly attack targeting Hindu tourists in Kashmir that it said was backed by Islamabad.

Pakistan denied involvement in the violence and had said it was preparing international legal action over the suspension of the treaty, which ensures water for 80% of its farms.

""Indus Waters Treaty was not really a part of (ceasefire) discussions,"" said a source from Pakistan's water ministry.

An Indian government source also told Reuters there was ""no change in stand"" on the treaty.

There was no immediate response from India's foreign ministry on the matter, or from officials at Pakistan's water ministry and the information minister.

The pact was one of many tit-for-tat measures taken by the South Asian nations after the Kashmir attack, including closure of land borders, suspension of trade, and a pause on issuance of almost all categories of visas to each other's citizens.

Two sources from the Indian government told Reuters that all measures taken against Pakistan, including on trade and visas, would remain in place despite the pause in violence between the countries.

India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.

India and Pakistan had engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday when India struck multiple locations in Pakistan that it said were ""terrorist camps"".

 European leaders tell Putin to agree to Ukraine ceasefire or face new sanctions ,"
                        
                        
                        Major European powers threw their weight behind an unconditional 30-day Ukraine ceasefire on Saturday, with the backing of US President Donald Trump, and threatened President Vladimir Putinwith ""massive"" new sanctions if he did not accept within days.

The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Ukraine set the start of the ceasefire for May 12 at a meeting in Kyiv, during which they held a phone call with Trump.

""So all of us here together with the US are calling Putin out. If he is serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it,"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a press conference.

""No more ifs and buts, no more conditions and delays.""

Soon after the European leaders' announcement, the Kremlin appeared to pour scorn on it.

""We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Interfax.

Western sanctions against Russia have been toughened repeatedly since its full-scale invasion in 2022, without ending the war. But following through on the threat would be a sign of growing Western unity after months of unpredictability in US policy since Trump's return to the White House in January.

After engaging directly with Russian officials, clashing publicly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and briefly cutting vital military aid to Kyiv, Washington has patched up ties with Ukraine and signed an agreement giving the US preferential access to new Ukrainian minerals deals.

Trump, who did not immediately comment publicly on the European leaders' remarks, has also signalled frustration with what Washington views as Putin's foot-dragging over a ceasefire.

""In the event that the ceasefire is violated, massive sanctions will be prepared, in coordination between the Europeans and the United States,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said.

By imposing new sanctions, the White House would be aligning itself more closely with western Europe, which has been rattled by a trade war in which Trump has imposed tariffs on them and other countries and has suggested he might not come to the defence of NATO allies that underspend on their defence.

Zelensky said he and the visiting leaders had agreed the unconditional ceasefire must start on Monday and cover air, sea and land. If Russia refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors, he said.

Peskov had been quoted as saying on Friday that Russia supported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of ""nuances"".

In remarks to US broadcaster ABC broadcast earlier on Saturday, Peskov had suggested Western military assistance for Ukraine must stop for a temporary ceasefire to take effect. ""Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine,"" he said.

TRUMP PHONE CALL

Macron said that if the ceasefire went ahead, it would be monitored mainly by the US and European countries would contribute.

Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now a senior security official, derided the idea of giving Russia an option between being sanctioned or giving Ukrainian forces an opportunity to rebuild.

""Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses!"" he wrote on X.

The European leaders said the terms of a peace deal would be negotiated during the 30-day pause in fighting.

""We have no illusions that the ceasefire will be breached,"" Zelenskiy said.

On the eve of the summit, the US embassy in Kyiv warned of a ""potentially significant"" air attack in the coming days.

When the European leaders arrived in Kyiv by train on Saturday, a screen on the platform announced the arrival of the ""Bravery Express"". Zelensky accompanied them as they paid their respects at a Kyiv memorial honouring Ukrainian soldiers killed in the war.

The visit falls on the final day of a May 8-10 ceasefire declared by Putin that Ukraine did not accept, denouncing it as a sham. Both sides have accused each other of violating it.

 Pope Leo tells cardinals they must continue 'precious legacy' of Pope Francis ,"
                        
                        
                        Pope Leo XIV signalled on Saturday he would continue with the vision and reforms of Pope Francis, telling the world's Catholic cardinals the late pontiff left a ""precious legacy"" that must carry on.

In his first meeting with all the cardinals since his election as pontiff on May 8, Leo also asked the senior clerics to renew their commitment to major Church reforms enacted by the landmark Second Vatican Council in the 1960s.

Leo said Francis, who died on April 21, broadly had a vision of opening the staid 1.4-billion-member Church to the modern world, had left an ""example of complete dedication to service.""

""Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey,"" the new pope told the cardinals.

The pontiff also asked the clerics to ""renew together our complete commitment"" to the reforms enacted by the Council, which included celebrating the Mass in local languages rather than Latin and pursuing dialogue with other religions.

He cited Francis' focus on ""courageous and trusting dialogue with the contemporary world in its various components and realities.""

Francis was pope for 12 years and often garnered criticism from conservative cardinals, who said he was watering down the Church's doctrine on issues such as inclusion of LGBT Catholics and women's leadership.

Leo, the former US Cardinal Robert Prevost, was a relative unknown on the global stage before his election as pontiff. He had spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru before serving as a senior Vatican official for the past two years.

The new pope said on Saturday he had taken his papal name partly to honour Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903), who was known as an advocate for social justice and pushed for fair pay and treatment of workers during the industrial revolution.

Leo XIV said the Church must now take the lead in facing newer threats to workers, such as artificial intelligence. He said AI posed ""new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour.""

Leo's two-hour meeting with the cardinals took a different format to that used by previous popes, who would typically offer a speech and expect the clerics only to listen.

This time, Leo gave a prepared address and then opened the floor to any cardinal who wanted to make a comment -- allowing the clerics to voice their opinions and concerns about the main issues facing the global Church.

""He listened very carefully, but he knows he's going to have to make the decisions,"" Irish Cardinal Sean Brady told Reuters. ""But we're here to help him.""

Spanish Cardinal Aquilino Bocos Merino described the meeting as ""very cordial and communal.""

CHINA DEAL COMES UP

Leo greeted each of the cardinals individually as they left the meeting, which was held in the same small Vatican auditorium where the cardinals had been gathering in the days before the conclave to discuss who should be the next pope.

Czech Cardinal Dominik Duka said one topic that came up was the situation of Catholics in communist China.

The Vatican and China in 2018 signed a controversial deal on the appointment of bishops in the country, which gives Beijing some input into their selection.

Conservatives have attacked the still-secret deal as a sell-out, but Duka told Reuters it was necessary to keep a dialogue open in places where the Church is oppressed, comparing it to dialogue between the Vatican and eastern European countries during the Cold War.

German Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, who openly clashed with Francis on issues concerning Catholic moral teaching, told Reuters that Saturday's encounter was ""very good and harmonious.""

To be elected as pope during the May 7-8 secret conclave at the Sistine Chapel, Leo required a two-thirds majority of 89 of the 133 voting cardinals.

Madagascar Cardinal D√©sir√© Tsarahazana told Reuters that Leo received more than 100 votes at the final ballot on the afternoon of May 8.

" India, Pakistan agree to ""full and immediate ceasefire"", says President Trump ","
                        
                        
                        Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturdayafter US pressure and diplomacy, announcing a sudden stop to a conflict that had seemed to be spiralling alarmingly.

The four days of fighting that began on Wednesday were the worst between the old South Asian enemies in nearly three decades and threatened to erupt into a full-scale war in one of the world's most volatile and densely populated regions.

There were briefly fears that nuclear arsenals might come into play as Pakistan's military said a top body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet.

But the defence minister said no such meeting was scheduled, hours after a night of heavy fighting in which the two countries targeted each other‚Äôs military bases and the combined civilian death toll rose to 66.

""Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,"" Foreign minister Ishaq Dar posted on X. ""Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!""

The Indian foreign secretary said the two countries' military chiefs had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5pm Indian time (1130 GMT), without using the word ""ceasefire"".

US President Donald Trump posted: ""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.""

HOTLINES AND DIPLOMACY

Dar told the broadcaster Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had actively helped to facilitate the agreement.

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, India's most senior diplomat, said the two military chiefs would speak to each other again on May 12.

India on Wednesday attacked what it said was ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Pakistani Kashmir and Pakistan, two weeks after 26 people were killed in an attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir.

Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the attack. Days of cross-border fire, shelling and drone and missile attacks followed.

Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now.

The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Kashmir attack, would continue to remain in abeyance.

The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir, and the two national security advisors over the course of 48 hours.

TALKS TO FOLLOW AT NEUTRAL VENUE

In a post on X, Rubio commended Modi and Sharif on the agreement, which he said included not only an immediate ceasefire but also the start of talks on ""a broad set of issues at a neutral site‚Äù.

Jaishankar said India had consistently maintained a firm and ""uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations"" and would continue to do so.

News of the ceasefire was greeted with relief on both sides of the border and Pakistan's airports authority said its airspace had been fully reopened.

Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Indian Kashmir, which bore the brunt of the fighting, welcomed the truce but added: ""If it had happened 2-3 days ago, the lives we lost would not have been lost.""

Pakistani news channels showed tanks returning from the border.

""Both Pakistan and India need to lift their large populations on virtually every measure of socio-economic development,"" said Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council. ""We are happy that a ceasefire will help both the governments to focus on this priority.""

Shuja Nawaz, distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council's South Asia Center, said the Indus treaty would figure prominently in the impending talks ""after a decent interval, which allows both governments to claim credit for what they've achieved until now"".

India and Pakistan have been locked in a dispute over Kashmir ever since they were born at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule partof Kashmir but claim it in full.

They have gone to war three times, including twice over Kashmir, alongside numerous smaller outbreaks of fighting.

India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India.

Pakistan rejects both charges. It says it only provides moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.

 China takes centre stage in Philippines' feisty midterm election ,"
                        
                        
                        In political rallies, Senate hearings and voter surveys ahead of Monday's midterm elections in the Philippines, China has been an overwhelming - and unusual - presence.

The shadow of its giant maritime neighbour has loomed over the Philippines for years, but as the country's two most prominent political clans flex their muscles in the usually low-key process to pick senators and local government leaders, relations with China have emerged as a political lightning rod.

The outcome could end up shaping the country's strategic positioning over the remaining half of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's six-year term, which began in 2022.

""Will we allow ourselves to return to the time when our leaders wanted us to become a province of China?"" Marcos asked voters at a rally in February, in a dig at predecessor Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter Sara, who is currently vice president and a key Marcos rival.

During his 2016 to 2022 term, Duterte shifted foreign policy on China, adopting conciliatory rhetoric and downplaying disputes in the South China Sea. The strategy drew concern from Washington and raised questions about the Philippines' longstanding security alliance with the United States.

In contrast, Marcos has moved to rekindle and deepen ties with Washington.

""These are hot button issues that many Filipino voters can relate to, particularly on the issue on China. There was a time in the past when foreign policy did not really matter that much during elections,"" said Ederson Tapia, professor of public administration at the University of Makati.

""But now it does.""

An April survey found that a majority of voters in the country of 110 million prefer candidates who assert Philippine sovereignty in the South China Sea, where the Marcos-led administration has taken a more assertive stance in its maritime confrontations with Beijing, which continue unabated.

It is a sentiment that Marcos has tapped into since he started his campaign for the slate of Senate candidates that he is backing.

In the February rally, Marcos pointed to his candidates, saying: ""None of them were applauding China when our coast guard was being bombed with water, when our fishermen were being blocked, when their catch was stolen, and our islands seized to become part of another country.""

China's embassy in Manila did not respond to questions from Reuters.

The Duterte camp enjoyed a surge of sympathy when he was arrested by the International Criminal Court in March and taken to The Hague, but Marcos' candidates remain ahead in polls and appear poised to dominate the Senate race.

A Duterte spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

DISINFORMATION PROLIFERATION

Through a months-long campaign, Marcos has kept up the pressure and focused on China as a key election issue, while his allies have taken aim at Sara Duterte for her silence on China's actions.

Sara, a likely future presidential candidate, was once a Marcos ally but now faces an impeachment trial on charges including a threat to assassinate the president if she herself was harmed.

In the Philippines, the 24-member Senate acts as the jury in any impeachment trial, making the midterms even more consequential in determining Sara Duterte's political future.

Sara, who has denied wrongdoing, has responded to her impeachment with defiance, asking the Supreme Court to nullify the complaint against her.

A strong mandate for Marcos would not only define his ability to govern decisively in the remaining three years of his term, but would also shape the 2028 presidential race, said Victor Andres ""Dindo"" Manhit, a political analyst and founder of Stratbase Group, a research and advisory firm.

Marcos is limited to a single term under the Constitution and is expected to anoint a successor. If she survives impeachment, Sara Duterte would also be eligible to run in 2028.

""Those who will run need to be tested on consistency with regard to these issues,"" Manhit said, referring to the protection of Philippines' maritime rights and sovereignty.

""And one of them is the current vice president. She has not spoken against this coercion by China.""

A spokesperson for Sara Duterte did not respond to a request for comment.

The midterm election comes amid a proliferation of disinformation in the Philippines. Up to 45 percent of discussions about the elections on social media have been driven by inauthentic accounts, Reuters reported last month.

The use of fake accounts and paid influencers for political operations is widespread in the Philippines, but a top security official and a senator alleged last month that Chinese state-sponsored groups might be attempting to influence Filipinos.

China's foreign ministry and its embassy in Manila have rejected the accusations.

 Judge orders temporary halt to Trump administration's government overhaul ,"
                        
                        
                        President Donald Trump's administration must temporarily halt its sweeping government overhaul because Congress did not authorize it to carry out large-scale staffing cuts and the restructuring of agencies, a federal judge said on Friday.

US District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco sided with a group of unions, non-profits and local governments, and blocked large-scale mass layoffs known as ""reductions in force"" for 14 days.

""As history demonstrates, the President may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,"" said Illston.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ruling is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul that has been led by Elon Musk, the world's richest person who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla TSLA.O.

Dozens of lawsuits have challenged DOGE's work on various grounds including violating privacy laws and exceeding its authority, with mixed results.

Trump directed government agencies in February to work with the Department of Government Efficiency to identify targets for mass layoffs as part of the administration's restructuring plans.

Trump urged agencies to eliminate duplicative roles, unnecessary management layers, and non-critical jobs, while automating routine tasks, closing regional field offices and reducing the use of outside contractors.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration‚Äôs unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation,"" said a statement from the coalition of plaintiffs.

""Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government ‚Äì laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that.‚Äù

Illston scheduled a hearing for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.

She said that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on merits of some of their claims in their lawsuit, which was filed on April 28 and alleged Trump exceeded his authority. It also alleged the Office of Management and Budget, DOGE and Office of Personnel Management exceeded their authority and violated administrative law.

Illston said plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm without the temporary restraining order, which she said preserves the status quo.

Illston said the plaintiffs submitted more than 1,000 pages of evidence and 62 sworn declarations and she highlighted some of the material.

For example, she said the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and its Pittsburgh office, which researches health hazards facing mineworkers, had 221 of the department's 222 workers terminated, citing the union. She gave similar examples at local offices of Head Start, which supports early learning, the Farm Service Agency and the Social Security Administration.

""The Court here is not considering the potential loss of income of one individual employee, but the widespread termination of salaries and benefits for individuals, families, and communities,"" Illston wrote in her ruling.

The US government said it offered assistance to make India and Pakistan start ""constructive talks"" while the Group of Seven (G7) major countries also urged the Asian neighbors to engage in direct dialogue amid heightened hostilities.

World powers have raised the alarm over the latest escalation in the decades-old India-Pakistan rivalry. India hit Pakistan with air strikes and missiles on Wednesday and since then the nuclear-armed countries have been clashing daily while launching strikes against each other's military installations on Saturday. Dozens have been killed.

The US, especially Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has held regular talks with both India and Pakistan since late April and urged them to de-escalate.

The US State Department late on Friday and early Saturday released three statements on Rubio's calls with Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir, and the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan.

It said Rubio urged them to ""re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation"" while offering US assistance ""in starting constructive talks"" to avoid future conflicts.

Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and writer for the Foreign Policy magazine, said Rubio's decision to call the army chief directly was ""the most consequential move the US has made"" since the start of the crisis:

""If you want to talk to the Pakistanis about de-escalation, you need to talk to General Munir.""

President Donald Trump said earlier this week the rising tensions were a shame. US Vice President JD Vance said a war would be ""none of our business.""

In recent years, India has been seen as a partner by Western powers to counter China's rising influence. Pakistan is a US ally although its importance has diminished since Washington's 2021 withdrawal from neighboring Afghanistan.

G7 URGES DIRECT DIALOGUE

In a G7 statement, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US, Britain and the European Union said they ""strongly condemn"" an Apr 22 Islamist militant attack in which 26 people were killed in India-administered Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, which denied the accusations and called for a neutral probe.

""We call for immediate de-escalation and encourage both countries to engage in direct dialogue towards a peaceful outcome,"" the G7 top diplomats said.

Muslim-majority Kashmir is claimed in full but ruled only in part by both Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan and has seen wars, insurgency and diplomatic stand-offs over the decades.

 Warm American welcome for new pope masks US church's deep divide ,"
                        
                        
                        As Pope Leo XIV celebrated his first Mass as pontiff at the Sistine Chapel on Friday, he spoke a few words in English. It was a reminder - if anyone needed one - that a baseball fan who hails from Chicago was now leader of the Roman Catholic Church.

For American Catholics, the elevation of Robert Prevost to the papacy was a shock, a cause for celebration and a chance for some fun. After the announcement, social media lit up with memes about Leo eating hotdogs, bringing deep dish pizza to the Vatican and switching out the Popemobile for a pickup truck.

But despite the warm embrace of his countrymen and women, the deeply divided US Catholic Church may ultimately pose some of the most serious challenges for the new pope.

Those divisions, which mirror more generalized political polarization in the US, are evident in a host of issues: immigration, same-sex couples, climate change and the role of women in the Church, among other issues.

The split has grown wider in recent years as a growing segment of conservative Catholics becomes increasingly vocal and assertive. Pope Francis - who was seen as more progressive-minded thanks to his views on climate change and migration - saw his popularity decline in the US over time as the conservative influence helped shape opinions: In 2024, about 75 percent of US Catholics viewed Francis favorably, down from about 90 percent in 2015, according to a Pew Research Poll.

Cathleen Kaveny, a theology and law professor at Boston College who has closely tracked the split between conservatives and progressives, said the new pontiff could salve some wounds between the sides while deepening others.

Kaveny expects Leo, with his expertise in canon law and administration at the Vatican, to embrace his predecessor's vision of a church dedicated to the poor and open to all, what she described as a ‚Äútrickle-up theory of paying attention to people and what they think.‚Äù

If Kaveny proves right, traditionalists and conservatives may balk. ‚ÄúPope Leo XIV is an institution builder and he will institutionalize Pope Francis‚Äô visions - or, at least, certain aspects of them,‚Äù she said.

Steve Bannon, the conservative strategist and Catholic who advised President Donald Trump during his first term, also expects continuity. ""He‚Äôs an ideological twin to Francis,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.

PRESIDENT AS POPE

That said, American conservatives may appreciate that the new pontiff will likely show more discretion than Francis, Kaveny said, perhaps shifting focus away from some of the more contentious issues such outreach to the gay and transgender faithful.

In their politics, US Catholics have swung more conservative, with right-wing media and Trump-era culture wars combining as powerful influence within the church. Catholics voted for Trump 59 percent-39 percent over Democrat Kamala Harris in the November presidential election, a 12 percentage point swing from 2020, according to exit polling by Edison Research.

Trump, whose cabinet is about one-third Catholic, expressed pride at having an American in charge at the Vatican. An AI-generated image of Trump dressed as pope was posted on a White House social media account last weekend; the president told reporters he had nothing to do with the image.

Despite Trump's welcome, Leo may also find himself in the crosshairs of Trump supporters, some of whom have described him as a globalist, liberal and woke-minded. Leo has a handful of disapproving posts about the Republican leaders' policies on the X account of Robert Prevost. Among the posts are one questioning Trump's migration policies and another reposting an article headlined, ""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.""

""He‚Äôs got that same Latin American liberation theology radicalness to him,"" Bannon said, referring to Leo. ""He‚Äôs virulently anti-Trump.""

The share of Americans who describe themselves as Catholic has changed little over the last decade, hovering around 20 percent, according to Pew Research. During that time, the Church has been rocked by sex abuse scandals that have resulted in costly legal settlements and bankruptcies, while dragging on church attendance and donations.

A number of US dioceses, including in Leo's hometown of Chicago, have been forced to close churches, while others have fallen into disrepair.

Despite Francis' cost-cutting efforts and financial management, the Vatican faces an $94.22 million budget shortfall, two sources have told Reuters, and a much larger funding gap in its pension fund.

'NO PLACE TO GO'

David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University, said that Leo‚Äôs ascension cements the movement ignited by Francis to broaden the appeal of the church and make it accessible to more people. At times that has come at the expense of tradition, such as the move by Francis to restrict the celebration of the Latin Mass, which enraged his conservative critics.

""The conservatives have no place to go. Leo is 69 and could be around for 15 to 20 years,‚Äù Gibson said. ‚ÄúThis is the church now - finding how to preach the Gospel in modern times. The conservatives will have to figure out how they‚Äôre going to live in that church.‚Äù

Still, Leo is an American, and experts said it remained to be seen how the novelty of the first US-born pope - and his understanding of US Catholics - could play out.

""There's a certain kind of opportunity he has in this moment to appeal and to be a symbol that can unite and that could go a way in pulling us together,"" said Nancy Pineda-Madrid, associate professor of theology at Boston College.

""I think in many ways he can stretch us here in the United States in ways that are wonderful and rich,"" she said.

" Iran to send Russia launchers for short-range missiles, sources say ","
                        
                        
                        Iran is preparing to deliver in the near future launchers for short-range ballistic missiles that the US said Tehran sent to Russia last year for use against Ukraine, according to two Western security officials and a regional official.

The delivery of the Fath-360 launchers - if it occurs - would help support Russia's grinding assault on its neighbor and reaffirm the deepening security ties between Moscow and Tehran.

With a 75-mile (120-km) range, the Fath-360 would give Moscow's forces a new weapon to fire at Ukrainian frontline troops, nearby military targets, and population centers close to the border with Russia, analysts said.

The US last September said that Iran delivered the missiles to Russia on nine Russian-flagged ships - which it sanctioned - and three sources told Reuters at that time that the launchers were not included.

The Western security officials and the regional official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the delivery of the Fath-360 launchers was imminent.

They declined to provide further details of the pending transfer, including why they thought the launchers were not delivered with the missiles.

Russia's defense ministry and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The US National Security Council referred inquiries to the State Department, which did not respond immediately. The CIA declined comment.

Russia and Iran have previously denied that Tehran had shipped the missiles or any other arms to aid the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Moscow launched in February 2022. US, Ukrainian and European officials say Iran has provided Russia thousands of drones and artillery shells.

In an apparent reference to the Fath-360s, US Army General Christopher Cavoli, the commander of US Central Command, last month told US lawmakers that Iran had donated to Russia more than 400 short-range ballistic missiles.

There have been no public reports of Iran transferring any other kinds of short-range ballistic missiles to Moscow or of Russian forces using the Fath-360.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATION FOR PEACE TALKS

Russia's deployment of the missiles could complicate US President Donald Trump's efforts to arrange a ceasefire and peace talks between Ukraine and Russia and to strike a separate deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program.

The regional official said that the indirect US-Iran nuclear talks mediated by Oman are among ""several reasons"" for the delayed delivery of the launchers.

The talks have encountered turbulence, although Iran on Friday said it agreed to hold a fourth round in Oman on Sunday.

Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said that Iranian officials would consider the issue of sending arms to Russia as separate from the nuclear talks.

""That the Iranians are negotiating on nuclear issues with the US will not be seen as connected to what they might do in collaboration with the Russians,"" he said.

Analysts said there could have been another complication: Iran had to modify European-made commercial trucks on which to mount the launchers for its own Fath-360 arsenal, and it may have had to do the same for Russia given its massive losses of vehicles in Ukraine.

With the launchers, Russia will be able to increase pressure on Ukraine, said the experts.

""It would be much easier (for Russian forces) to launch a strike much faster ... against high-value targets,"" said Fabian Hinz, a research fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ""They (Fath-360s) don't need a lot of launch preparations. Their flight time is incredibly short.""

Deploying the Fath-360 could allow Russia to reserve its more advanced missiles, like the Iskander, for longer-range strikes at critical infrastructure, including the power grid, straining Ukraine's precious missile defenses, the analysts said.

The Fath-360 ""is designed to be handled and operated by people with relatively little training,"" said Ralph Savelsberg, an associate professor at the Netherlands Defense Academy.

""Why would they (Russia) buy inferior Iranian missiles? The only reason I could think of is that they cannot produce a sufficient number of their own missiles,"" he said.

""They're not super accurate and they don't carry a very large payload. But it just adds to Ukraine's headaches.""

 European leaders head to Kyiv to show support after Putin's parade ,"
                        
                        
                        The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland headed to Kyiv on Saturday for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a show of unity a day after Russia's Vladimir Putin hosted his allies in a Victory Day parade on Red Square.

The summit will discuss a US and European proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the Russian war in Ukraine that if refused by Moscow would see them jointly impose new sanctions, a French diplomatic source said, adding that the step had not yet been finalised.

The visit by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is the first time the leaders of the four countries have travelled together to Ukraine.

""Alongside the US, we call on Russia to agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to create the space for talks on a just and lasting peace,"" the four European leaders said in a joint statement.

The visit comes at an unpredictable diplomatic moment in Russia's more than three-year-long war against Ukraine. US President Donald Trump is pushing for a rapid peace after tearing up the policies of his predecessor since entering the White House in January.

After engaging directly with Russian officials, clashing publicly with Zelenskiy and briefly cutting vital military aid to Ukraine, the Trump administration has patched up ties with Kyiv and signed an arduously-negotiated minerals deal.

There has also been a palpable shift in tone from Trump, who has signalled growing frustration with Putin's foot-dragging over a ceasefire and Russia's restatement of its demands for a settlement.

Trump has threatened to step up sanctions against Russia but he has also said he could abandon the peace effort if there is no breakthrough. He called on Thursday for a 30-day ceasefire and Zelenskiy said he would be ready to implement it immediately.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Friday that Russia supports the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire in the conflict, but only with due consideration of ""nuances"".

Putin hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders at a Red Square military parade on Friday to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two, sending a defiant message that he is not isolated.

On the same day, European ministers voiced support for a special tribunal to prosecute the Russian President and his officials for crimes of aggression, showing support for Zelenskiy who on Thursday poured scorn on Putin for planning a ""parade of bile and lies"".

'BALL IN MOSCOW'S COURT'

On the eve of the summit, the US embassy in Kyiv warned of a ""potentially significant"" air attack in the coming days and told its citizens to be ready to seek shelter in the event of air raid sirens.

The four foreign leaders will meet Zelenskiy on Saturday morning and are also expected to pay their respects at a memorial in central Kyiv to honour Ukrainian soldiers killed in the war.

They are expected to host a virtual meeting with other leaders to update them on progress being made for a future coalition of an air, land, maritime and ""regeneration"" force that would help regenerate Ukraine's armed forces after any peace deal, Britain's Downing Street said.

The visit falls on the final day of a May 8-10 ceasefire declared by Putin that Ukraine did not accept, denouncing it as a sham. Both sides have accused each other of violating it.

Zelenskiy said on Thursday he told Trump in a telephone call that a 30-day ceasefire would be a ""real indicator"" of progress towards peace with Russia, and that Kyiv was ready to implement it immediately.

The French diplomatic source said work had not been completed on the proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, but that the US and European allies hoped they were ""at a moment of convergence"".

""What could happen in the coming hours and days, there could be an announcement of a ceasefire either of 30 days or compartmentalized, which is still being discussed,"" the source said.

Merz, who became Germany's chancellor this week, said on Friday that the ball was now in Moscow's court.

""It is solely there that the decision will be made as to whether there is a chance, starting this coming weekend - that is, at the beginning of next week - to enable a longer ceasefire in Ukraine,"" he said.

" China and the US to talk trade war ceasefire, not peace ","
                        
                        
                        China and the United States start their first major Trade War Two meeting on Saturday to pull back from what analysts describe as a lose-lose situation for their economies, without much clarity on what a win would look like for either side.

China is at the epicentre of US President Donald Trump's global trade war that has roiled financial markets, upended supply chains and fuelled risks of a sharp worldwide economic downturn.

Washington wants to reduce its trade deficit with Beijing and convince China to renounce what the US says is a mercantilist economic model and contribute more to global consumption, which would imply, among other things, painful domestic reforms.

Beijing resists any outside interference with its development path as it sees industrial and technological advancement as crucial to avoid the middle income trap. It wants Washington to remove tariffs, specify what it wants China to buy more of, and be treated as equals on the global stage.

The two sides seem much further apart and at greater risk of a major fallout than during their first trade war in Trump's previous term.

And as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and chief trade negotiator Jamieson Greer meet China's economic tsar He Lifeng in Switzerland, none of these outcomes look realistic, analysts say.

The triple-digit, two-way tariffs are not the only point of tension in the weekend talks. Non-trade issues such as fentanyl, tech restrictions and geopolitics including the war in Ukraine are likely to further complicate the path to any resolution to a trade conflict that is disrupting the global economy.

Indeed, in an indication of how deeply non-tariff issues are in the mix, China is sending a top public-security official to the talks, a source familiar with the plans said.

""They're not going to resolve anything this weekend, other than just trying to determine if there's going to be a process, and what the agenda items will be,"" said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese business affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

The best-case scenario for financial markets at this early stage would be an agreement to bring down tariffs from an excess of 100 percent - widely seen by markets as a virtual trade embargo - to levels that would allow products to flow each way, but still be hefty on American and Chinese businesses.

Trump, who unveiled the details of a new trade agreement between the United States and Britain, has signaled that punitive US tariffs of 145 percent on Beijing would likely come down, and on Friday floated an alternative figure for the first time, saying on his social media platform that 80 percent ""seems right."" Even that is 20 points above the level he pledged on the campaign trail last year to levy against Chinese goods, and it was unclear how it would be received by the team from China, if it is presented by his negotiating team at all over the weekend.

""I expect Beijing will insist on receiving the same 90-day waiver on tariffs that all other countries received to create conducive conditions for negotiations,"" said Ryan Hass, director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, adding that breakthroughs are unlikely.

""Since the US decisions to escalate tariffs were made arbitrarily, the decision to de-escalate tariffs can similarly be made arbitrarily.""

Most analysts don't expect a waiver. But a tariff reduction, however small, and an agreement for follow-up talks that could eventually encompass non-trade issues like fentanyl would still be seen as a positive outcome by investors.

""If there is a temporary truce or symmetrical rollback of tariffs, that would be conducive to future potential holistic negotiation efforts,"" said Bo Zhengyuan, Shanghai-based partner at consultancy firm Plenum.

TEMPORARY DE-ESCALATION

While either side might be able to dress any rollbacks as an early win to their domestic audiences, Chinese factories and their workers are likely to start feeling the tariff pain in coming months, while Americans are staring at higher prices and unemployment.

And the root cause of the conflict will still be there.

The lopsided global trade environment in which most economies around the world rely too heavily on affordable and efficient Chinese production on the supply side and wealthy American consumers for demand won't be fixed by next week.

But markets for now are at least relieved that the world's leading powers have a chance to walk back from a path of escalating threats that investors feared might spill over from trade into finance and other areas.

Lynn Song, ING's chief Greater China economist, expects any de-escalation to bring back tariffs to around 60 percent, in line with Trump's pre-election pledges.

This would ""still be high enough to bar many products with suitable alternatives,"" but also ""a level that allows importers to buy products without substitutions with less pain,"" she said.

RHETORICAL POSTURING

Before the Saturday meeting, much of the back-channel preparations between China and the United States were bogged down by disputes over fentanyl, the seniority of negotiating officials, and the tone of rhetoric used by the US, Reuters reported on Friday.

Conflicting statements from both sides over who approached whom led to a further hardening in Beijing's public messaging, as one state newspaper warned of a ""protracted struggle"".

However, China last week signalled through a state media-affiliated blog that engaging in talks ""does no harm at this stage"" and that Beijing can ""use this opportunity to observe, and even draw out the US's true intentions"".

Analysts say that Beijing's attempts to portray Washington as the more anxious and pressured party give it political cover to engage in talks, as well as projecting strength domestically.

""We are not watching anymore for who blinks first, but for how either side will spin the other as having blinked first,"" said a Beijing-based diplomat.

                        Pakistan and India launched strikes and counter-strikes against each other's military installations on Saturday, prompting US calls for the nuclear-armed neighbours to begin talks and defuse their escalating conflict, the most intense since 1999.

Fears that the countries' nuclear arsenals might come into play spiked when the Pakistan military said a top military and civil body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet, but the defence minister later said no such meeting was scheduled.

Officials from both sides showed a willingness for now to take a step back following the day's exchanges.

Pakistan's foreign minister, Mohammad Ishaq Dar, told local television that if India stops here, then ""we will consider to stop here"".

The Indian military said regarding Pakistan's military attacks on Saturday that ""all hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded to appropriately"".

Analysts and diplomats have long feared that conflict between the rivals could escalate into the use of nuclear weapons, in one of the world's most dangerous and most populated nuclear flashpoint regions. Unlike India, Pakistan does not have a no-first-use doctrine.

Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja Asif played down any immediate nuclear threat, calling it a ""very distant possibility"".

""We shouldn't even discuss it in the immediate context,"" he told ARY TV. ""Before we get to that point, I think temperatures will come down. No meeting has happened of the National Command Authority, nor is any such meeting scheduled.""

Pakistan's information minister did not respond to a request for comment and the military said it had no immediate comment.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Pakistan's Army Chief General Asim Munir and India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Saturday, urging both sides to de-escalate and ""re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation"".

""India's approach has always been measured and responsible and remains so,"" Jaishankar said on X after the call with Rubio.

Indian Wing Commander Vyomika Singh told a press conference India was responding to moves by Pakistani forces but would show restraint if Pakistan did so as well.

""The Pakistan military has been observed to be moving their troops into forward areas, indicating offensive intent to further escalate the situation,"" she said.

""Indian armed forces remain in a high state of operational readiness. Indian armed forces reiterate their commitment to non-escalation, provided it is reciprocated by the Pakistan military.""

STRIKES, COUNTER-STRIKES

As tensions remain high, residents across Pakistan and India have rushed to stockpile food and other essential supplies, while families living near the border fled to safer areas. Indian authorities have installed sirens in high-rise buildings in New Delhi, some 650 kilometres (400 miles) from the border.

Pakistan early on Saturday said it had targeted multiple bases in India, including a missile storage site in India's north, in response to prior attacks by the Indian military.

India said there was limited damage to equipment and personnel at four air force stations. The military said there were several high-speed missile attacks on air bases in Punjab state and that India had responded to the attacks.

Five civilians were killed in the attacks in the Jammu region of Indian Kashmir, regional police said. Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full but rule it in part.

Blasts rang out across Indian Kashmir and the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in neighbouring Punjab until early morning on Saturday. Jammu streets were empty hours after loud blasts were heard and projectiles were seen flying across the city sky.

""Jammu city has never been hit before. Never thought we will be hit like this,"" said 60-year-old Rajeev Gupta, whose brother was wounded by a shell.

Pakistan said that, before its offensive, India had fired missiles at three air bases, including one close to the capital, Islamabad, but Pakistani air defences intercepted most of them.

Locked in a longstanding dispute over Kashmir, the two countries have engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday when India launched strikes inside Pakistan on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"". Pakistan vowed to retaliate.

Pakistan's information minister said in a post on X that Saturday's military operation was named ""Operation Bunyanun Marsoos"". The term is taken from the Koran and means a firm, united structure.

India has said its strikes on Wednesday, which started the latest round of clashes that have left more than 50 people dead in both countries, were in retaliation for a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir last month.

Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the tourist attack. Since Wednesday, the two countries have exchanged cross-border fire and shelling, and sent drones and missiles into each other's airspace.

Despite growing Western calls for peace, defence experts said the opposite seemed to be happening.

One of the air bases is in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, which is just outside the capital Islamabad, and the other two are in Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, which neighbours India.

" Ahead of China-US talks, Trump says 80% tariff 'seems right' ","
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump said on Friday an 80 percent tariff on Chinese goods ""seems right,"" for the first time suggesting a specific alternative to the 145 percent levies he has imposed on Chinese imports ahead of closely watched weekend talks.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and chief trade negotiator Jamieson Greer will meet Chinese economic tsar He Lifeng in Switzerland for talks aimed at containing a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.

It could be the first step toward resolving a damaging trade conflict that has already entangled global supply chains.

China is also sending a top public-security official to the talks in Geneva, a source familiar with the plans said. The development, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is an indication of the importance of the issue of fentanyl trafficking to the talks and the wider US-China relationship.

Trump has linked the two issues, using the fentanyl scourge as the rationale for the initial imposition of punitive import taxes on goods from China, Canada and Mexico earlier this year.

China‚Äôs embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

""China should open up its market to USA ‚Äì would be so good for them!!! Closed markets don't work anymore!!!"" Trump wrote in an all-caps social media post. ""80 percent tariff on China seems right. Up to Scott B.,"" he added moments later.

China's foreign ministry has decried what it calls abusive and bullying economic tactics, and said that China remains firmly opposed to what it calls an unsustainable approach to trade by the US.

While Trump has indicated on several recent occasions that he expects the punitive tariff rates he has imposed on China to come down, he had not until now floated a potential figure for where they might fall to.

Even though 80 percent is just around half the current rate, it remains extraordinarily high and is above even the hefty 60 percent rate that Trump had said he would impose during his campaign for president last year. It was not clear how well it would be received by China amid what Bessent has already cast as an effective trade embargo between the two countries.

What level tariff rates settle at ‚Äì and not just for China ‚Äì has been a central focus for investors rattled by months of financial market volatility arising from the chaotic rollout of Trump's aggressive trade policies.

 

STOCKS SLIP AFTER TRUMP REMARKS

 

U.S. stocks, which have recouped a significant chunk of their losses since mid-February's record high, were modestly lower on Friday after Trump's social media post. The dollar was weaker against a basket of major trading partners' currencies.

Since taking office in January, Trump has hiked the tariffs paid by US importers for goods from China to 145 percent, in addition to those he imposed on many Chinese goods during his first term and the duties levied by the Biden administration.

China hit back by imposing export curbs on some rare earth elements, vital for U.S. manufacturers of weapons and electronic consumer goods, and raising tariffs on US goods to 125 percent. It also imposed extra levies on some products including soybeans and liquefied natural gas.

The weekend talks in Geneva have been described by Trump administration officials as a step towards de-escalating tensions with China. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said the meeting seemed ""very promising"" to US officials.

""We're seeing extreme respect, treating both sides with respect,"" Hassett said in an interview with CNBC. ""We're seeing collegiality and also sketches of positive developments.""

Trump's push on tariffs is widely seen to be elevating risks to the US economy, with concerns that they will lift prices for American consumers and businesses and rekindle inflation while at the same time cutting into the demand that has so far propped up the job market.

Indeed, Trump is already facing dropping approval ratings over his handling of trade as Americans brace to pay more for clothes, electronics, toys and countless other goods that emerge from Chinese factories.

China's government is seeking to mitigate closures, bankruptcies and job losses at manufacturers who are struggling to find viable alternatives to the US market.

Representing the meeting's host, Swiss Vice President Guy Parmelin, who also serves as economic minister, emerged from separate bilateral meetings in Geneva with the US and Chinese delegations with optimistic words for reporters.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already a success,"" Parmelin said. ""The two sides are talking ... If a road map can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions.‚Äù

""We could imagine everything ‚Äì we could imagine a mutual suspension of customs duties during the course of the discussions,"" Parmelin added, noting they could extend into Sunday or even Monday. ""That's up to the parties.""

 India-Pakistan conflict offers rich intelligence opportunity for China ,"
                        
                        
                        The conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir offers a potentially rich intelligence harvest for China in its own rivalry with India as it gleans data from its fighter jets and other weapons used in action by Pakistan.

Security analysts and diplomats say China's military modernisation has reached a point where it has the ability to deeply scrutinise Indian actions in real time from its border installations and Indian Ocean fleets as well as from space.

""From an intelligence perspective, this is a rare target of opportunity right on China's borders involving a key potential adversary,"" said Singapore-based security analyst Alexander Neill.

Two US officials said a Chinese-made J-10 Pakistani jet fighter shot down at least two Indian military planes - one of them a French-made Rafale fighter. India has not acknowledged the loss of any of its planes while Pakistan's defence and foreign ministers have confirmed the use of J-10 aircraft but not commented on which missiles or other weapons were used.

The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries around the world to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle.

Competing regional giants and nuclear powers, India and China are widely seen as long-term strategic rivals, sharing a 3,800 (2,400 mile) Himalayan border that has been disputed since the 1950s and sparked a brief war in 1962.

The most recent standoff - that started in 2020 - thawed in October as the two sides struck a patrolling agreement.

Security analysts say both sides have taken steps to strengthen their military facilities and capabilities along the border, but it is also from above that China packs an intelligence gathering punch.

The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) notes that China now fields 267 satellites - including 115 devoted to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and a further 81 that monitor military electronic and signals information. It is a network that dwarfs its regional rivals, including India, and is second only to the US.

""Both in terms of space and missile tracking capabilities, China is much better off now in terms of being able to monitor things as they happen,"" said Neill, who is an adjunct fellow at Hawaii's Pacific Forum think-tank.

China's defence ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' questions about the deployment of its military satellites and other questions about its intelligence gathering.

Pakistan's military media wing and information minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any information sharing with China.

Pakistan has previously said it has an ""all-weather strategic, cooperative partnership"" with China.

India has not commented on the issue, but its top diplomat in Britain, High Commissioner Vikram Doraiswami, told Sky News on Thursday that China's relationship with Pakistan was not a concern for India.

""China requires a relationship with all of its neighbours, that includes us,"" he said.

MISSILE DEPLOYMENTS

Chinese military intelligence teams would be eager to garner information on any Indian use of air defences and launches of cruise and ballistic missiles - not just in terms of flight paths and accuracy but command and control information, analysts and diplomats say.

Any deployment of India's BrahMos supersonic cruise missile - a weapon it developed jointly with Russia - would be of particular interest, some analysts say, given they do not believe it has been used in combat.

China has also beefed up its intelligence gathering at sea. It has been increasingly active in the Indian Ocean in recent years, with China deploying space tracking ships as well as oceanographic research and fishing vessels on extended deployments, open source intelligence trackers say.

Regional diplomats say that while the Chinese navy has been relatively cautious about extensive warship deployments into the Indian Ocean, still lacking a broad network of bases, it actively seeks intelligence with these other vessels.

Over the last week, some trackers noted unusually large fleets of Chinese fishing vessels moving apparently in unison to within 120 nautical miles of Indian naval drills in the Arabian Sea as tensions rose with Pakistan.

Pentagon reports on China's military modernisation and analysts note that China's fishing fleets routinely perform a coordinated militia function that plays an important intelligence gathering role.

""These vessels may double up as listening posts, tracking development rhythms and response patterns, feeding early warning, naval intel to their sponsors,"" wrote open source tracker Damien Symon in an X post that highlighted the deployment of 224 Chinese vessels near Indian naval exercises on May 1.

Chinese officials do not usually acknowledge the existence of fishing militia or intelligence work carried out by other nominally-civilian vessels.

Given its deep and broad strategic relationship with Pakistan, Beijing can also be expected to fully exploit its network of envoys and military teams there for key nuggets.

""The presence of Chinese military advisers and other personnel in Pakistan is well-known given how Pakistan's Ministry of Defence has been importing some of its most advanced military hardware from China, so we can be certain the PLA would be able to access relevant data,"" said James Char, a Chinese security scholar at Singapore's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.

                        Pope Leo XIV celebrated his first Mass on Friday in the Sistine Chapel where he was elected less than 24 hours earlier, warning of the dangers caused by a lack of faith and hoping the Catholic Church could be a beacon lighting the world's ""dark nights"".

Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost and the first US pope, looked calm as he delivered the Mass in the famous, frescoed chapel with the same cardinals who chose him to be the 267th pontiff and the successor to Pope Francis.

Dressed in relatively simple white and gold vestments, Leo, who was born in Chicago but spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, said a few words in English before continuing his homily in fluent Italian.

In the homily, Leo, 69, painted a picture of the Church he would like to see, saying he would seek to serve as the ""faithful administrator"" for the Church as a whole.

The new pope, who leads 1.4 billion Catholics around the world, acknowledged that the Christian faith is sometimes ""considered absurd"" and the preserve of ""the weak and unintelligent"".

""A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society,"" he said.

Leo was scheduled to have lunch with the cardinals and they will then be free to leave the Vatican and return to their homes around the world.

SWIFT AND SECRET APPOINTMENT

The pope was elected at the end of a two-day conclave that was wrapped up on Thursday evening when white smoke billowed from the chimney on the Sistine Chapel.

Given the nature of the conclaves, when cardinals are shut away from the world and sworn to secrecy, little or nothing is likely to emerge - at least for now - about how Leo obtained the required two-thirds majority of the vote so swiftly.

The successor to Pope Francis, who died last month at the age of 88, inherits a number of major challenges, ranging from a budget shortfall to divisions over whether the Church should be more welcoming towards the LGBT community and divorcees, and should let women play a greater role in its affairs.

He will also have a packed agenda, with the Vatican celebrating a Holy Year that brings millions of additional tourists to Rome.

Before Leo's election, US cardinals had largely been written off as papal contenders because of a widespread assumption that the global Church could not be run by a superpower pope.

However, he also holds Peruvian citizenship, meaning that he has deep knowledge of both the West and less developed nations.

US President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Leo. However, the new pope has a history of criticizing Trump and Vice President JD Vance's policies, according to posts on the X account of Robert Prevost.

Leo worked for decades in the north of Peru, first as a missionary and later as Bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. Catholics took to the streets of the small city in northwestern Peru, and church bells rang out to celebrate the election of a man who they embrace as one of their own.

One of the clues to what kind of a Church leader Leo will be was in his choice of name. The last pope with this name was Leo XIII, who led the Church from 1878-1903. He was known for his devoted focus to social justice issues.

Prevost became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given few media interviews and is known to have a shy personality.

Francis brought him to Rome two years ago to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world's bishops.

" Blasts rock Indian Kashmir, Amritsar as Pakistan conflict escalates ","
                        
                        
                        Blasts rang out across Indian Kashmir and the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in neighbouring Punjab state late on Friday, with the Indian military saying they were shooting down drones in the worst fighting with Pakistan in nearly three decades.

The explosions in Amritsar - the first heard in the three-day-old conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours - could mark a further expansion in the hostilities that have alarmed world powers.

Projectiles and flashes were seen in the night sky above the Indian Kashmir city of Jammu that was plunged into a blackout in the second night of blasts in the region's winter capital, officials and a Reuters journalist said.

""Drones have been sighted ... They are being engaged,"" said an Indian military official who asked not to be named.

Ten blasts were heard near the airport in the Indian Kashmir city of Srinagar and there were explosions in a dozen other locations in the contested region, other security officials added.

There was no immediate comment from Pakistan which dismissed Indian accusations that it had launched attacks on the same area on Thursday night.

The old foes have been clashing since India struck several areas that it described as ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Pakistan on Wednesday in retaliation for a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir last month.

Pakistan dismissed Indian accusations that it was involved. Both countries have exchanged cross-border fire and shelling and sent drones and missiles into each other's airspace.

Around 48 people have been killed since Wednesday, according to casualty estimates on both sides of the border that have not been independently verified.

Tourists and villagers fled border zones, residents rushed to stockpile food and people were told to stay indoors in cities in Kashmir and beyond. India's cricket boardon Friday suspended the IPL - the sport's richest tournament - and the Pakistan Super League postponed its remaining eight matches.

The relationship between India and Pakistan has been fraught with tension since they gained independence from colonial Britain in 1947. The countries have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir, and clashed many times.

CLASHING ACCUSATIONS

India's airforce earlier said Pakistan used Turkish drones to attack 36 locations on India's west and northwest, in Kashmir and further afield in states bordering Pakistan all the way to the edge of the Arabian Sea on Thursday night into Friday morning.

India responded with drones on targets in Pakistan and destroyed one air defence system, Indian Air Force officer Vyomika Singh told a media briefing.

Pakistan Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had dismissed earlier Indian accusations of Pakistani attacks as ""baseless and misleading"" and said Pakistan had not carried out any ""offensive actions"".

In Pakistani Kashmir, officials said heavy shelling from across the border killed five civilians, including an infant, and wounded 29 others in the early hours of Friday.

The fighting is the deadliest since a limited conflict between the two countries in Kashmir's Kargil region in 1999.

Sirens had blared for more than two hours earlier on Friday in in Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs.

Tourists fled the city by road as the airport was closed.

""We really wanted to stay but the loud sounds, sirens, and blackouts are giving us sleepless nights. Our families back home are worried for us so we have booked a cab and are leaving,"" said a British national who did not want to be named.

Schools and coaching centres were closed in the Bikaner region of India's desert state of Rajasthan, and residents near the Pakistan border said they were asked to move further away and consider moving in with relatives or using accommodation arranged by the government.

Further south in Bhuj in Gujarat, authorities said tourist buses had been kept on standby in case they needed to evacuate people near the Pakistan border.

India's Directorate General of Shipping directed all ports, terminals and shipyards to increase security, amid ""growing concerns regarding potential threats"".

A Bell 212 helicopter had crashed into the Maduru Oya reservoir in central Sri Lanka with a dozen armed forces personnel on board.

Six died after they were rescued and rushed to hospital, Sri Lanka Air Force spokesman Group Captain Eranda Geeganage said.

" Ukraine says Russia violating its own 3-day ceasefire, calls it a 'farce' ","
                        
                        
                        Ukraine's foreign minister said on Thursday Russia had repeatedly violated its own 3-day ceasefire hours after it began and called the initiative a ""farce"", while Moscow said Kyiv had continued fighting.

There was, though, a drop-off in combat activity after the ceasefire announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin came into force in the early hours of Thursday, with a respite in the drone and missile attacks that had rattled Ukrainian cities earlier this week.

""Predictably, Putin's 'Parade ceasefire' proves to be a farce,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X, referring to the truce which coincides with a May 9 parade on Moscow's Red Square to commemorate the end of World War Two.

""Russian forces continue to attack across the entire frontline,"" Sybiha wrote. ""From midnight to midday, Russia committed 734 ceasefire violations and 63 assault operations, 23 of which are still ongoing.""

He said Kyiv was notifying the United States and European states about Russia's actions.

The Russian defence ministry, cited by Interfax news agency, said that Ukraine, in turn, had carried out 488 attacks on Russian targets and twice tried to break through the border in the Kursk region.

The two sides did not immediately comment on each other's battlefield reports, which Reuters could not independently confirm.

A late night report issued by the General Staff of Ukraine's military nearly 24 hours in the proclaimed ceasefire said 154 clashes had been recorded. Russian forces, it said, had launched one missile attack and 15 air strikes.

The governor of southeastern Zaporizhzhia region said a Russian drone had struck a car in the south of the region, killing a passenger.

In central Poltava region, the head of the regional military administration said air defence units had downed a missile deployed by Russian forces. The missile damaged private homes, but caused no casualties.

UKRAINE DERIDES KREMLIN CEASEFIRE

Ukraine has not committed to abide by the ceasefire, calling it a ruse by Putin to create the impression he wants to end the war, which began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Putin says he is committed to achieving peace.

Reuters journalists with a Ukrainian drone unit near the front in eastern Ukraine said a small Russian infantry raiding party had tried to advance on Thursday, but had been stopped by drones piloted by members of the unit.

Ukrainian soldiers observed the clash on a live feed streamed onto monitors in their bunker.

""The infantry are still coming,"" said one of the soldiers in the unit, a 33-year-old who identified himself by his callsign, ""Mikha.""

A second person in the same unit, who identified himself as Nazar, said in the six hours since the Russian ceasefire started, there had been three Russian strikes on his section of the front. Asked if the ceasefire was holding, he said: ""The facts speak for themselves.""

A Ukrainian military spokesman earlier said Russia had continued assaults in areas on the eastern front and prosecutors said two people had been wounded along with the 55-year-old woman killed by bombs fired at the northern Sumy region.

The Russian ceasefire falls on the 80th anniversary of the World War Two defeat of Nazi Germany, for which Putin is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders ahead of a military parade on Red Square on May 9.

Ukraine, like the West, marks the anniversary on May 8.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky marked the day by taking a rare walk in central Kyiv to pay his respects to fallen Ukrainian soldiers at a vast mound of Ukrainian flags planted on a grassy verge on the central square.

There was no sign of his security detail in the selfie video he filmed as he passed pedestrians on the city's main drag, at one point pausing to say ""hi"" as cars tooted their horns and deriding Friday's planned pomp-filled ceremony in Moscow.

""There will be a parade of cynicism. You simply cannot call it anything else. A parade of bile and lies. As if not dozens of allied states, but Putin personally defeated Nazism,"" he said.

Ukraine launched successive drone attacks on Moscow this week, which had forced the closure of airports in the Russian capital and the grounding of airliners.

Russia's aviation authority Rosaviatsiya said on Thursday evening that airline schedules, heavily disrupted earlier in the week, were now operating normally.

Zelensky said on Thursday that he had told US President Donald Trump in a telephone call that a 30-day ceasefire was a ""real indicator"" of moving towards peace with Russia and Kyiv was ready to implement it immediately.

Zelensky said he had also spoken to Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who assured him that his government could be relied upon for continued support. The Ukrainian president also spoke to European Union Executive Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen.

                        US President Donald Trump called on Thursday for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, warning that Washington and its partners would impose further sanctions if the ceasefire is not respected.

Ukraine has expressed readiness to accept a US proposal to enact an immediate 30-day ceasefire, while Russia has proposed only a three-day ceasefire to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two on Thursday.

Trump said in a social media post: ""If the (30-day) ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions.""

""Hopefully, an acceptable ceasefire will be observed, and both Countries will be held accountable for respecting the sanctity of these direct negotiations,"" Trump said.

""This ceasefire must ultimately build toward a Peace Agreement. It can all be done very quickly, and I will be available on a moment‚Äôs notice if my services are needed.""

Trump has said he wants to the end the war in Ukraine but his administration has also threatened to abandon its attempts to broker a deal if Russia and Ukraine do not make headway.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday he told Trump in a telephone call that Kyiv was ready for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia ""starting this minute.""

The Ukrainian president said Russia had to demonstrate its readiness to end the war, starting with an unconditional ceasefire.

Ukraine's foreign minister said on Thursday Russia had repeatedly violated its own 3-day ceasefire hours after it began and called the initiative a ""farce"", while Moscow said Kyiv had continued fighting.

 Ultra-rich shoppers wield perverse economic aegis ,"
                        
                        
                        Champagne keeps flowing as beer refills slow. Ritzy brands are expressing more confidence and pricing power than Main Street counterparts grappling with tariffs and anxious shoppers. This divergence suggests that the ultra-rich could buttress an economic slump, at least for a while, but also betrays a shaky system.

The tippy top of the opulence pyramid has been insulated from the disquiet so far. Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari bucked a trend of companies yanking financial guidance and stuck with its 2025 outlook. Hermes CFO Eric du Halgouet said his company would simply charge more for its silk scarves to offset US import duties. Cashmere merchant Brunello Cucinelli expects 10 percent sales growth both this year and next. By contrast, Kering and Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, whose closets house more accessible luxury items, were less optimistic.

It‚Äôs a reminder that scarcity and craftsmanship help justify ever-higher prices. Ferrari limits production, Hermes customers wait years for Birkin bags and Cucinelli‚Äôs artisans command $8,500 for a coat. An index tracking Europe‚Äôs biggest luxury stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 Index by about 80 percentage points over the past decade.

This pattern extends beyond fashion and autos. Posh hotels have generated 6 percent more revenue per room this year, while other lodging suffered declines, according to hospitality research outfit STR. At $7 billion Life Time, whose upscale gym memberships start at $200 monthly, the company‚Äôs share price is up 85 percent since its initial public offering in October 2021. Over the same span, $8 billion discount chain Planet Fitness gained just 28 percent.

Such examples also reflect a widening divide. The top 10 percent of American earners increased their spending 58 percent in the four years through September 2024, Moody‚Äôs Analytics found. Consumption growth from everyone else barely outpaced 21 percent inflation recorded over the period. Elite purchasing power is expanding, too, with the top decile‚Äôs net worth up 40 percent, or more than $30 trillion, from 2019 through 2024, US Federal Reserve data shows. More pointedly, UBS research shows that the richest 1.5 percent of the population holds $214 trillion, or about half, of the world‚Äôs lucre, while the bottom 40 percent claims just $2.4 trillion.

It‚Äôs no wonder mass-market retailers from Target to Macy‚Äôs say shoppers are already trading down for cheaper goods. Higher tariffs threaten to accelerate the trend, raising costs for consumers just scraping by. The danger is that economies leaning so heavily on their wealthiest are not only unequal, but also unsustainable.

Upscale fitness chain Life Time said on May 8 that it roughly tripled its first-quarter net profit to $76 million from a year earlier on an 18 percent increase in revenue, thanks to higher average membership fees and more spending at the gyms.

Discount rival Planet Fitness on May 8 reported a 20 percent rise in net income during the first three months of the year, to $42 million, on a 6 percent gain in revenue at clubs open at least a year, crediting its marketing campaign.

 Donald Trump may help Ukraine despite himself ,"
                        
                        
                        Donald Trump is not Ukraine‚Äôs friend, despite his new minerals partnership with the country. At times the US president has undermined Kyiv in its war with Russia ‚Äî for example, by temporarily suspending critical intelligence in March ‚Äî and he may yet do it irreparable harm.

But Trump‚Äôs turbulent first few months have some unintended benefits for Ukraine. Take his trade war with China. The president seems to have initially underestimated the challenges of launching a fight with Beijing at the same time as imposing tariffs on allies. The US administration has since postponed many of the import taxes on other countries ‚Äì perhaps partly because it realises it needs friends in its fight with the People‚Äôs Republic.

This gives Europe some leverage with Trump. Its leaders can tell the US president that if he wants help taking on China, he must not undermine Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have already helped engineer a promising meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Pope Francis‚Äô funeral.

The US President‚Äôs trade war is also harming the global economy, which has driven down the oil price. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude has fallen from $82 to $61 since Trump took power. That is good news for Ukraine because Moscow relies on oil revenues to fund its war effort.

While the unintended impact of Trump‚Äôs actions could be positive for Ukraine, his intentions remain hard to fathom. Washington proposed a peace deal on April 17 that was fairly favourable to Moscow, including a plan to recognise Crimea as part of Russia. The US also said it would pull out of the ceasefire talks that it is brokering if the two sides did not agree a deal fast. That raised the possibility that Washington might cut off all aid to Ukraine, including critical intelligence, and lift US sanctions on Russia if Kyiv did not accept the peace terms it was proposing.

More recently, however, Trump has swung a bit in Ukraine‚Äôs direction. He has told Vladimir Putin to ‚Äústop‚Äù bombing Ukraine and said the Russian president might not be serious about the peace talks. What is more, Washington‚Äôs new minerals partnership with Kyiv gives the Trump administration a stake in the country‚Äôs future, though it does not give Ukraine a security guarantee.

Trump might, of course, swing back to bullying Zelensky. But many pro-Ukrainian lawmakers in the US president‚Äôs own party have now found their voice. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says 72 colleagues are ready to back legislation imposing secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil. This could drive down the Kremlin‚Äôs revenues to the point that Putin faces only hard choices ‚Äì making it more likely he would accept a decent peace deal.

Trump has floated such a policy ‚Äì and US officials have prepared new banking and energy sanctions against Russia, Reuters reported last week. Whether the president is actually willing to approve this package is unclear, but he would face opposition from his own supporters if he were now to take hostile action against Kyiv. He may not be willing to risk that now that his popularity has fallen because of his economic and other policies. If so, his actions would have a further unintended benefit for Ukraine.

EUROPE‚ÄôS TIME TO LEAD

Europe has too often followed the US lead on Ukraine. This passivity means Trump may still reach a deal with Putin that undermines European security.

More recently, European countries led by the UK and France have been trying to put together a coalition that would help protect Ukraine if there is a peace deal. They also agreed with Kyiv a counterproposal to the US plan to end the war. This was more favourable to Ukraine ‚Äì including no recognition of Russia‚Äôs occupation of Ukraine, no limits on the country‚Äôs ability to arm itself, and no restrictions on allies giving it military support.

This is not enough, though. European countries need to supercharge their support for Kyiv now ‚Äì both to persuade the US president not to sideline them in peace talks and to protect Ukraine if Trump cuts off all support.

Probably the biggest thing Europe could do is provide Kyiv with a huge chunk of cash so it can outlast Russia in a war of attrition. The best way of doing this is to mobilise the sovereign assets that Russia had stashed in Europe before it invaded Ukraine. Of the $300 billion in reserves that the West froze at the start of the war, about three-quarters are in the EU and the UK.

Some lawyers think confiscating these assets would be illegal. A more legally solid alternative is a ‚Äúreparation loan‚Äù, an idea I helped develop. This would involve European countries lending money to Ukraine backed by Kyiv‚Äôs claim for war damages against Moscow. If the Kremlin refused to pay reparations, the lenders could net its debt to them against the frozen Russian assets they are sitting on.

Washington would ideally participate in such a loan. But since it only has control of around $5 billion of Russia‚Äôs assets, its involvement is not essential.

A few months ago, the EU might have been afraid that acting without the US would prompt China and other countries to switch from euro to dollar-denominated assets. But that risk has receded now that Trump has launched a trade war against the People‚Äôs Republic and undermined faith in the greenback by flirting with the idea of firing the head of the independent Federal Reserve. That is yet another example of how his actions could have an unintended benefit for Ukraine.

 US exceptionalism becoming a matter of perspective ,"
                        
                        
                        Warren Buffett made his name advising devotees never to bet against the United States. Yet even Uncle Sam‚Äôs greatest fan is implicitly questioning whether the days of US outperformance are over. When he announced plans to bow out on Saturday, Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway was less focused on America Inc than ever before, with over half of its investment portfolio in cash and its highest ever weighting to non-US assets.

Yet 48 hours later at the Milken Institute Global Conference, Scott Bessent took up Buffett‚Äôs old baton with relish, urging his audience to go all-in on the United States. The entirety of the country‚Äôs economic history, quipped the Treasury secretary, can be distilled in just five words: ‚ÄúUp and to the right.‚Äù In whom should investors trust: Buffett or Bessent? Is the era of US investment outperformance over ‚Äì or is it here to stay?

The greenback‚Äôs recent slide raises a third possibility: both might be true at once. For domestic investors, who count their gains in dollars, US assets may continue to power ahead ‚Äì even as the opposite might be true for foreigners, who are exposed to currency risk. Much like the weird world of quantum physics, where particles have no fixed position until they‚Äôre observed, the existence of US exceptionalism may increasingly depend on an investor‚Äôs perspective.

The last decade of US investment dominance has had three underlying drivers. The first was simple: unprecedented fiscal largesse. President Donald Trump‚Äôs 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act slashed levies. President Joe Biden‚Äôs 2022 Inflation Reduction Act ramped up spending. The net result was that the US budget deficit climbed from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2015 to nearly 6 percent in 2019, using the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs measure of general government net borrowing, before rebounding again to nearly 7.5 percent of GDP in 2024. At 3.7 percent, the average budget deficit of the other members of the G7 group of advanced economies was barely half the United States‚Äôs level last year.

With Trump‚Äôs second coming, austerity looks further away than ever. Congressional budget resolutions passed in early April imply massive tax cuts and relatively puny spending cuts, potentially adding $5.7 trillion to federal debt over the next decade, according to Reuters. The International Monetary Fund reckons the US deficit will still be 5.6 percent of GDP in 2028, against an average for the rest of the G7 of 3.4 percent.

Importantly for investors, the US Treasury market is unfazed: the benchmark 10-year yield is currently lower than at the beginning of the year. There‚Äôs little opposition from either policymakers or markets to keeping the US fiscal engine firing.



The next big driver of US outperformance has been its leadership in technology and artificial intelligence, exemplified by the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks ‚Äì Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon.com, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla ‚Äì which account for roughly a third of the S&P 500 Index‚Äôs market capitalisation.

The bull case for this theme is that America‚Äôs technological edge is sustainable and poised to have profound macroeconomic effects. New York University economist Nouriel Roubini argues that the US leads the rest of the world in 10 of 12 ‚Äúindustries of the future‚Äù, from defence to fusion energy, and that the ongoing AI investment boom will see the economy‚Äôs potential growth rate to approach 4 percent by 2030, from around 2 percent to 3 percent in recent years.

Sceptics see a bubble instead. Jim Chanos, founder of short-selling specialist Kynikos Associates, observes that while US tech capex indeed contributed nearly a full percentage point to GDP in the first quarter of 2025, the last time it did so was right before the peak of the dot-com bubble in early 2000.

In contrast to the fiscal engine, financial markets have recently been wobbling on this second theme. US equities have had a wild 2025. Tech stocks and Tesla have been particularly hit. Yet the S&P 500 has roared back from a near-20 percent drawdown in early April and is now just 4 percent below its 2024 year-end level. Faith in the Magnificent Seven may be dented ‚Äì but there‚Äôs little sign yet that Uncle Sam‚Äôs tech engine has ground to an ignominious halt.

That leaves the third driver of US outperformance: the long bull market in the dollar. In the decade to March 2024, the US dollar appreciated by nearly 30 percent against the euro, for example, which improved euro-based investors' returns to investing in US financial assets by nearly 3 percentage points per year. For investors in equities, these currency gains were a nice little add-on, topping up the S&P 500‚Äôs annualised 13 percent total return in US dollars to 16 percent. For fixed-income investors, they were the major draw given that yields were languishing at multi-decade lows.

In 2025, however, this third mighty engine of US exceptionalism has gone into reverse. The United States‚Äôs net international investment liabilities have reached an all-time high of nearly 90 percent of GDP, and the net flow of income from its international assets has completely dried up. The Bank for International Settlements‚Äô real effective exchange rate index, meanwhile, rates the greenback as about as expensive as at any time in 40 years. Combined with the White House‚Äôs open endorsement of a weaker currency, that‚Äôs resulted in a screeching handbrake turn. The DXY US Dollar Currency Index has dropped by 8 percent this year. The greenback‚Äôs sharp depreciation this week against a number of Asian currencies suggests further weakness may be on the way.

Is it worth investing in US markets even if they‚Äôre powered by only two of their three historic engines? That depends on where you sit. US assets may do just fine in dollar terms, fuelled by continued American leadership in tech and turbocharged by further fiscal boosts. For foreign investors, however, American assets will be less compelling if a bear market in the greenback leaves them racing to stand still.
Such confusing quantum states have existed for long periods before. In the half-decade leading up to April 2008, for example, the S&P 500 returned just over 13 percent annually in dollar terms ‚Äì just like in the decade to 2024. But the greenback was on the skids, losing nearly a third of its value over that time. For an unhedged euro-based investor, those exceptional returns were thus cut almost in half.

Of course, US investors too can get on the right side of the trade simply by buying foreign assets. Buffett himself opined on Saturday that he ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt want to be owning anything that we thought was in a currency that was really going to hell.‚Äù That may prove a valuable parting shot from the Oracle of Omaha.

 Dial ‚ÄòD‚Äô for dominatrix in Dhaka! ,"
                        
                        
                        Police raids of city hotels to bust sex rackets have always provided titillating headlines for tabloids and the gutter press. 

The truism in ‚Äúsex sells‚Äù can never be underestimated. 

In recent times, these raids have taken a new dimension with the inclusion of TV cameras. 

The videos usually show police moving in with startled clients and women trying to run or cover their faces.

While all videos are similar in content, they get millions of views plus a long list of comments, from strict sermons to salacious encouragement. 

Truth is, many get a beastly satisfaction from seeing the predicament of others.

The word ‚ÄúSchadenfreude‚Äù seems apt!  

Others patiently pause and play the uploaded video on social media to diligently probe the women, although by the time police and the camera enter, the faces are all covered in veil. 

‚ÄúHONEY, WAKE ME UP AT 3, WE WILL BE EXPECTING THE POLICE!‚Äù

If you decide to even stay at a hotel with names like ‚ÄúSweet Rose Tonight‚Äù, ‚ÄúHappy Dreams‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlue Star‚Äù or ‚ÄúHotel Relax‚Äù then better be ready for a tap on the door, say around 3am. 

The following events will most probably won‚Äôt be sweet and the star plus the sky may just fall on your head. 

Hearing banging at the door at an ungodly hour you will wake up irritated. 

If you happen to stay with someone you plan to claim as your wife then better have the wedding certificate at hand. 

Or how about plastering a photocopy on the door, with the warning: just married, do not disturb!

But if you want to say she is your friend then, buddy, some lengthy explanation may be needed. 

How about a call to the parents! Hell, no! 

Anyway, the video of such a busting, which is now causing a social media uproar, involves two ladies who were reportedly running a bondage and sado masochistic service in the city. 

The duo and their dungeon is now out in the open along with their accoutrements.

One of my friends came to me after seeing the news and exclaimed: ‚ÄúI am shocked!‚Äù 

Shocked because you were never expecting it, or shocked because you hadn‚Äôt discovered it earlier, I replied.    

Naturally, I got a look of revulsion. 

LEATHER, BONDAGE AND WHIPS, 70S STYLE: 

Several media houses reported the busting of a BDSM operation in Dhaka decrying the presence of deviant and perverted desires. 

Actually, if we really want to trace the root of sado-masochism, a trip down memory lane is needed. 

In the late 70s, the astronomical success of the Bollywood film Sholay triggered a genre called curry western, which influenced countless movies plus a range of written fiction, both in India and Bangladesh. 

In Bangladesh, the template of the curry western, set against a mountainous area dominated by brigands in masks, was used for the highly successful fictional crime crusader, called Dasyu Moonlight. 

In the books, Moonlight is an attractive woman who takes up the role of a masked highway robber, stealing from tyrants, to help the oppressed. 

Moonlight‚Äôs appearance was similar to that of a dominatrix: clad in a body hugging leather dress, wearing a mask, leather boots, and wielding a whip with nails.

And she lived in a cave! 

After reading one book, the common conclusion: once whipped by this masked vigilante, the light of your life will be gone and the chances of seeing another moon becomes very bleak. 

She will beat the moonlight out of you!

The avenger for the persecuted, Moonlight books often contained graphic details of violence and torture. 

I would say Mrs Emma Peel on steroids!

Do not know why the series disappeared but long before Bangladeshis even knew what BDSM stood for, they actually had a foretaste of it.

My late grandmother once found a copy of the Moonlight series tucked underneath a heap of textbooks and flew into a rage. 

She used the word Bikrito Mostishko, meaning perverted head, several times.

About forty years later, while thinking about the Moonlight series and the latest discovery of BDSM practices, a sociological link did not seem absurd. 

At about the same time, when this book was published, a wide variety of magazines, ostensibly to report on crime across the country, printed grotesque/graphic news about violence, killing, beatings where many of the perpetrators were women. 

These magazines often portrayed women under suspicion or facing a trial as beasts, deriving pleasure from inflicting pain on others. 

In the 70s and 80s, a staple of local movies was the vamp girl, the evil woman who took pleasure in beating the good guy and his love interest. 

Many of the attributes of the vamp are similar to that of a dominatrix. She drinks, swears, smokes, has no moral scruples, revelling at the scene of the good being tortured. 

The point is, the concept of sado masochism had been present in society for decades although not directly under the BDSM label. 

Several years ago, the residence of an actor was raided by the law, where velvet handcuffs, restraining equipment and a gimp outfit was found. 

However, the discovery of these items was kicked into the long grass, possibly to save the reputation of the actor. 

She is still around although not sure if the dungeon is in operation or not. 

In the latest case, where two ladies were apprehended, a video showing the beating of a man, his hands and legs tied by a cord, has come out in the open.

The bloke, whoever he is, must be mortified since the cat is out of the bag. 

The law will ask him and the girls questions to find out the demand of this rather unorthodox culture. 

This information is needed to understand the changing dynamics of sexual behaviour among urbanites.

While puritans will draw a stark line between normal and the abnormal, others would also stress the need to understand how and why the definition of pleasure is changing to move into darker territory. 

To end on a lighter note, here‚Äôs a personal anecdote. 

Back in the early 90s, London phone booths were used to advertise all kinds of sensual services with small hand written cards mentioning telephone numbers and the services offered.  

Most were straightforward but one particular caught my eye.

It read: I will be unkind and cruel, violent and vicious. For the unforgettable torture of your life, call‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

 China‚Äôs automakers will lead a race to the bottom ,"
                        
                        
                        Donald Trump‚Äôs global trade war is set to heat up competition outside the world‚Äôs two largest auto markets, China and the United States. Yet both the People‚Äôs Republic and Detroit will share in the pain.

Washington had locked Chinese carmakers out of America before the US president slapped 25 percent tariffs on auto imports this month. Though Trump on Tuesday agreed to prevent auto tariffs from stacking on top of other duties and to offer local manufacturers some relief from charges on imported parts, his double-digit levies on vehicles will nonetheless force companies like GM, Toyota, and Hyundai, into a race to grab market share in other regions.

That spells trouble for China. Autos are a growth engine, accounting for 10 percent of the country‚Äôs GDP and 6.5 percent of exports last year, according to Tommy Wu, senior economist at Commerzbank. They also are a symbol of China Inc‚Äôs ability to keep factories humming at home and to achieve technological dominance overseas.

In China, domestic demand for cars was already weak. BYD, Geely, SAIC and compatriots sent nearly 6 million vehicles abroad last year, a 19 percent year-on-year increase. Overall, automakers in the country have capacity to supply half market of about 90 million.

Now, Washington‚Äôs broader trade assault against China could leave carmakers with even fewer buyers in the Middle Kingdom. At the opening of the Shanghai auto show last week, Chinese automakers, suppliers, and software providers told Breakingviews that their focus this year will be on selling more elsewhere.

Chart shows that exports account for a growing percentage of China's sales of internal combustion engine passenger vehicles, whereas exports are less significant as a proportion of electric-car sales.

ROADBLOCKS

That strategy looks increasingly fraught. Russia, the biggest overseas market for Chinese marques, is turning hostile to outsiders too. In the wake of the Ukraine conflict, Made-in-China cars flooded into the eastern European country to fill the void left following hurried exits by Western rivals including Toyota, Volkswagen, and Stellantis.

By last year, Chinese peers including Geely and Great Wall, accounted for more than half, of the Russian market, and these sales alone made up around a fifth of China‚Äôs auto exports, per Rhodium, a New York-based research group. Beginning in 2025, however, Moscow introduced quasi-tariffs by hiking a recycling fee for each vehicle sold. Local brands can reimburse this fee. Foreign ones cannot.

China‚Äôs auto exports to Russia in the first two months of the year amounted to around 60,000 vehicles, suggesting the first quarter total will fall far short of the roughly 170,000 Chinese exports tallied over the same period last year, per International Trade Centre data. It‚Äôs a sour commercial outcome for China whose foreign minister, Wang Yi, during a trip to Moscow in April described the duo as ‚Äúfriends forever, never enemies‚Äù.

Of course, the US and Russia aren‚Äôt the only ones erecting barriers to China‚Äôs automaking might. Turkey, Brazil and the European Union are among those attempting to put up walls too. The bloc increased tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3 percent last October.

Only a handful of countries that do not have sizeable auto brands or local manufacturing to safeguard are truly open to Chinese imports. These include Australia, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. The UK also remains an opportunity for now because it has not matched Brussels‚Äôs tariffs on electric vehicles. In total, the cluster of economies that welcome Chinese carmakers probably represents around 10 million in combined annual sales, per Rhodium.

CHERY ON TOP

Sending cars to these dozens of small, fragmented markets is hard work, but one Chinese company is making a success of it. Anhui-based Chery sold its first car abroad in 2001 and has expanded to sell vehicles in more than 100 countries, becoming China‚Äôs largest auto exporter, according to a prospectus, for its planned initial public offering in Hong Kong. In the first nine months of 2024, the state-owned company‚Äôs overseas sales rose by more than 35 percent to 80 billion yuan and the group achieved a pre-tax margin of over 7 percent, similar to General Motors.

However, it has never cracked the United States, and many of its individual markets are tiny. This strategy is like trying to strip meagre meat from chicken ribs, says Yu Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. Chery‚Äôs total sales are dwarfed by the nearly $180 billion revenue GM reported for the full year 2024.

Chart shows that China's auto exports are well diversified, and major markets include Russia, Central and South America, Middle East, Africa and the European Union, among others.

As others try to emulate Chery, competition in these modest markets will intensify. And, here, the Detroit 3‚Äôs global footprint overlaps with Chinese exporters‚Äô targets: only around 40 percent of Stellantis‚Äô sales are in North America; nearly a third of Ford‚Äôs, and about a fifth of GM‚Äôs are outside the US, per LSEG.

Europe is Ford and Stellantis‚Äô largest market beyond the United States. South America is the next largest for Stellantis, and GM has sizeable operations there too. Places like Mexico, where internal combustion engines are still popular, will become key battlegrounds. Some 75 percent of China‚Äôs exports last year were gas guzzlers.

The signs of saturation are emerging thick and fast. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect Ford‚Äôs South America revenue growth to slow to under 4 percent this year, compared with 31percent in 2024; GM and Stellantis‚Äô South America unit sales are likewise expected to show low single-digit growth.

Meanwhile, China‚Äôs Passenger Car Association warns auto exports from the country may decline for the first time in five years. Japanese and American companies‚Äô China sales fell by 18 percent and 23 percent last year, respectively, according to Automobility, a consultancy. Stellantis, Mitsubishi and Renault, have effectively left the market. GM took a $5 billion writedown in December, some of which related to plant closures in the People‚Äôs Republic. Nissan, has slashed capacity in the country too.

Shows many automakers in China are using less than half of their production capacity.

Chinese champions are due for a shakeup too. State-owned Dongfeng, which works with both Honda, used about half of its passenger vehicle capacity in 2024 and is discussing a merger with fellow state automaker Changan, one of Ford‚Äôs JV partners, for example.

The importance of the auto industry to China, though, means its carmakers are unlikely to cut capacity as quickly as global peers. State-owned enterprises are also typically less fussed about profits than their private rivals. Trump‚Äôs trade war will hurt carmakers around the world, not least the People‚Äôs Republic. But China Inc. might have a higher tolerance for pain.

" Paint Dhaka red with a Tk 1,000 note! ","
                        
                        
                        If someone had told me thirty years ago that Dhaka is expensive, I would have laughed! 

In 1995, Dhaka was a city where one could easily be a king for a day with Tk 1,000 in their wallet. 

It‚Äôs true! 

Well, one can still have a comfortable day with that amount, but she or he will certainly not be in the lap of luxury. 

For a thousand bucks, you will be able to manage three comfortable meals at a desi restaurant with a friend, but no fancy drinks. 

Nowadays, one has to be strategic with one‚Äôs plans if one is to have a day out for only Tk 1,000. 

In fact, the best option is not to go out at all! 

With that amount, one can easily get 1 kg beef or three medium-sized chickens.

Get a few tips from an aunt, cook at home, head for the roof with a few homemade yoghurt drinks, marvel at the stars, enjoy the summer evening breeze and the night can still be quite memorable!

However, if you are climbing the walls at home and are desperate to get away, here is a guide on how to stretch that Tk 1,000 for entertainment, food, and even a touch of nature while leaving enough for a smoke or two. 

WATCH A MOVIE AT A TRADITIONAL CINEMA HALL 
Just a week after Eid-ul-Fitr, while the Cineplex was doing brisk business, a large number of cine lovers bemoaned that just one outing at a movie with a friend set them back nearly Tk 2,000. 

The price of tickets has seen a sharp rise recently. 

With a box of popcorn, two drinks, ticket prices and transport cost, quite a bit more money is needed for a relaxing few hours at the movies for two. 



So, to cut down on the price, head for a more traditional cinema hall. The Modhumita is still available, along with the Ananda and Chondo. 

And two tickets cost only Tk 300. 

Two cups of machine vended coffee, crisps, and a smoke during intermission will add another Tk 100 to the bill. 

It might not have the extravagance of the Cineplex, but it retains an inimitable feel as posters from forty to fifty years ago provide an unmatched experience of celluloid history and evolution. 

The disadvantage? No air conditioning. But the fans do work quite well.  

At Modhumita, if you are not in a rush, take time and go from one poster to another, and appreciate the keen artwork that gives a glimpse into the star-studded film landscapes of eras past.  

The thrill isn‚Äôt to be taken lightly. After all, in the decade after liberation, a major film genre was the extravagant costume drama, featuring sumptuous kingdoms, complex palace intrigue, swashbuckling heroes, mysterious sorceresses, and enchanting princesses. 

That template has all but disappeared! 

But that may be a story for another time. 





TWILIGHT AMIDST NATURE OR HISTORY 

If you want a more culinary flavour to your excursion, there are two great options for those on a tight budget. To really cut down on expenses head for the Dhaka University campus. 

The ‚ÄúVC Chottor‚Äù - the open space opposite the vice-chancellor‚Äôs residence - has been turned into a park with soft lights and sitting arrangements. 

And, to cater to all the growing students, a smorgasbord of street food is on offer!

For that essential cup of piping hot milk tea, you should try the Tong Tea shop inside the business faculty premises. 



For an even more memorable evening, you can head to Old Dhaka and spend a few hours at Beauty Boarding, the historical home now turned into a boarding house cum restaurant that serves delicious luchi and vegetables in the evening. 

Surrounded by greenery, the Old Dhaka institution is a time capsule with very few touches of modernity. 

The walls whisper rebellious sentiments of the pre-independence period and the thrumming energy of the anti-autocracy movement of the 80s. 

For Tk 200, you and your date can have a very hearty meal. 

No one will ask you to leave, so sit back and enjoy a touch of Bohemian twilight. 

Acquaintance with a renegade poet or a staunch socialist may be the icing on the cake. 

End the evening at Nazira Bazar at Kazi Alauddin Road with tea from the several stalls offering a wide variety of brews from the regular milk tea to tea with cream on top. 

For some added thrills, try a delicious sweet betel leaf filled with an assortment of spices. 

Those with more daring taste buds can go for the betel leaves that are set on fire and then placed inside the mouth. 

A flaming end to a fabulous day and all done with a Tk 1,000 note. 

Truly, with strategic planning, a whole day can be made into a unique experience. 

Instead of going to the cinema, you can always head towards Sadarghat for a boat trip, eat at a floating restaurant, and then, on the way back, stop at Wari for tandoori tea. 

So, instead of splurging money for an hour at a swanky, overpriced eatery, a little planning may give you a day to truly remember. 

With all these options, you must wonder what I would do with a Tk 1,000 to spend in Dhaka. 

Well, I would visit the Lalbagh Fort or the Narinda Christian Cemetery, eat Nehari at Arsalan in Lalbagh and then sip tea at the VC Chottor. 

I invite you to take the Tk 1,000 challenge yourself and let me know what particular Dhaka delights you uncover.

 AI weakness makes YouTube Alphabet‚Äôs new lynchpin ,"
                        
                        
                        Through its 26-year run, a 6,000 percent run-up in its share price, and dominance of the global search engine market, Google owner Alphabet has become a $1.8 trillion internet goliath. It operates the world‚Äôs most popular operating system in Android, developed some of the crucial technological innovations behind artificial intelligence, and runs a colossal cloud computing service. Only among this jumble of assets could YouTube, now the most-watched source of video content, seem almost lost in the shuffle. As rapid shifts in AI shake its search foundations, investors may be overlooking a $500 billion star inside the company.

Exactly 20 years ago, when Netflix was still a mail-order DVD service, former PayPal employees Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim posted the social media platform‚Äôs first short, a 19-second clip entitled ‚ÄúMe at the zoo‚Äù. The open invitation for anyone to upload and share quickly caught fire; the same year, comedy show ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù posted a sketch featuring comedians Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell in a Beastie Boys music spoof.

Google snapped up YouTube for $1.7 billion in stock to complement its mission ‚Äúto organise the world‚Äôs information‚Äù. Since the deal closed in 2007, the platform has flourished. According to ratings firm Nielsen, in March of this year, YouTube accounted for 12 percent of all television usage in the United States ‚Äì putting it ahead of all traditional sources like Walt Disney, Netflix or Comcast‚Äôs NBC.

This doesn‚Äôt just go for iPad-toting kids: Adults 35 years and older make up half of viewers. Sure, the legion of celebrities minted by the service - like MrBeast, Dude Perfect and PewDiePie ‚Äì have a certain adolescent appeal. But analysts at MoffettNathanson forecast that YouTube‚Äôs subscription services will surpass cable operators Comcast and Charter Communications by the end of next year, with nearly 11 million members.

Nonetheless, it has not won its parent company an outsized valuation. The ratio of Alphabet‚Äôs enterprise value to estimated 2026 EBITDA is lower than at Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Apple, according to Visible Alpha.



Problems elsewhere might be part of it. Advertising shown alongside Google‚Äôs ubiquitous search results accounted for 57 percent of Alphabet‚Äôs $350 billion in revenue last year. Search can, fundamentally, be broken down by how it's used: queries for general information, say; or a hunt for a product to buy. When it comes to digging up information, the explosion of chatbots like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT are a rising threat. The ease of asking a know-it-all robot for answers gets around the hassle of scouring search results entirely.

Perhaps sensing the danger, Google has started prominently including its own AI-generated summaries at the top of search pages, sticking them in nearly 43 percent of results at the end of last year, according to one study. But that risks stealing eyeballs from the links that are Google‚Äôs value proposition to website owners and advertisers: clickthrough rates declined over 7 percent quarter-over-quarter on desktop for queries using terms like ‚Äúwhat,‚Äù ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù ‚Äúwhere‚Äù and ‚Äúhow.‚Äù

For shopping searches, meanwhile, specialised rivals are growing. More than half of Americans now start ecommerce queries on Amazon.com, according to eMarketer. Amid these pressures, Google‚Äôs slice of the overall global search advertising market dipped to 89.8 percent in January from 93.1 percent in May 2023, according to Bank of America citing research from Statcounter. ChatGPT may have eaten up as much as 15 percent of Google‚Äôs query volume, Bernstein analysts reckon.



AI at least aids Alphabet‚Äôs cloud computing division, which supplies rented muscle for crunching the bits behind the chatbots. Revenue increased 64 percent to $43 billion in 2024 compared to two years prior. But the company is a perennial third place behind Amazon and Microsoft. Its $32 billion acquisition of Wiz, announced in March, is a move to catch up by offering cyber security. Still, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai looks to be overpaying, and regulators could look askance.

Indeed, trustbusters already want to pare back Google‚Äôs clout. Judges have now found that Alphabet runs an illegal monopoly in both the search and digital advertising markets. Government litigators want to break off key units like the Chrome web browser and are specifically warning about Alphabet‚Äôs role in the AI race.

That places a spotlight on YouTube. Since its content is community-generated, it doesn‚Äôt bear the burden of stumping up like Netflix, which reports content obligations through March of $22 billion. However, Alphabet shares roughly 50 percent of advertising revenue with monetised accounts. That means slimmer operating margins than the service behind ‚ÄúAdolescence.‚Äù

A push into subscriptions for the generally free-to-watch platform helps. Wall Street analysts expect YouTube will rake in more than one-third of its revenue from its Premium plan, which includes music, and its more costly traditional-TV-replacement streaming bundle, according to Visible Alpha. All told, YouTube is forecast to generate $70 billion in total revenue in 2026. Valued at 7 times, a tick under Netflix‚Äôs multiple, the enterprise is worth $490 billion.



Unscrambling that from Alphabet‚Äôs other units is tricky. Goldman Sachs analysts say that the cloud business could be worth some 30 times its estimated operating profit of approximately $14 billion next year. Search, advertising and services, meanwhile, might generate a little more than $116 billion of such profit, assuming a 40 percent margin on forecast revenue. Apply Alphabet's overall 12-time multiple to that number, add the two together, and that‚Äôs $1.8 trillion of value.

Total it all up, add in net cash, and the company‚Äôs market capitalisation would be $2.4 trillion, or a third above where it is today.
A recession, the likelihood of which is increasing rapidly, could very well wallop Google and YouTube. Advertisers, especially brand marketers ‚Äì whom YouTube is preparing to court at an event in May ‚Äì could pull back sharply if consumers turn glum. Overall, US advertising could contract by $50 billion in a downturn, more than 11 percent, according to MoffettNathanson estimates.

Then again, entertainment has thrived during economic crises. Hollywood‚Äôs golden age dawned at the onset of the Great Depression. Deep links into Alphabet‚Äôs overall advertising guts probably make any separation difficult. But with regulators pushing a breakup in other areas and problems mounting in its core business, YouTube looks deserving of a star status that investors, thus far, seem to have overlooked.

 The importance of Apr 29 ,"
                        
                        
                        There are a number of reasons that make Apr 29 a very special day, bringing both sadness and joy.

Apr 29 is International Dance Day, a day to ‚Äúlet your hair down‚Äù and enjoy yourself. Country dances around the world are celebrated with both the old and the young having an enjoyable time. I remember that the International Dance Day message author for 2014 was the French choreographer and dancer Mourad Merzouki and part of his message read:

‚ÄúCulture, more than any discourse, unites. So have courage and take risks despite the obstacles and the hatred with which you will no doubt be confronted; the beauty of the world will always be by your side. Like dance has been for me. With its singular force to eliminate social and ethnic distinctions, leaving but the movement of bodies in their essence, of human beings returning to their pure expression, unique and shared.‚Äù

In Bangladesh, we remember the devastating cyclone of Apr 29, 1991 - Cyclone 2B - which devastated the coastline and off-shore islands of Chittagong, Chakoria and Cox‚Äôs Bazar. 

Although the official death toll was 138,000, it is estimated that very many more perished on that fateful night. It took several weeks to recover the bodies of the victims. As many as 10 million people, by some accounts, were left homeless by Cyclone 2B. Additionally, a million head of cattle were lost. Because of this, and the heavy loss of crops, shortage of food supplies posed a critical danger to the survivors.

Apr 29 is also observed as ‚ÄúWorld No-Golf Day‚Äù because on this day in 1993 the Global Anti-Golf Movement (GAG‚ÄôM) was launched at a meeting in Penang, Malaysia by some Asian environmental organisations. 

At that time, the cost of playing golf in places like Japan had sky-rocketed and golf tourism started whereby Japanese businessmen would travel to countries like Thailand and Indonesia where new golf courses were being built. Small farmers were being pushed off their agricultural land which was gradually transformed. Exotic soil and grass, chemical fertilisers, fungicides and weedicides, as well as machinery were all imported to substitute for natural ecosystems. The environmental impacts included water depletion and toxic contamination of the soil, underground water, surface water and the air. This in turn led to health problems for local communities, populations downstream and even golfers, caddies and chemical sprayers in golf courses.

And lastly, Apr 29, 1945, was the day on which Adolf Hitler realised that he would soon be killed by the approaching Soviet Army. He had learnt that day how the Italian wartime leader Mussolini had been brutally killed and his body put on public display. Hitler was determined to avoid that sort of end. He and his longtime companion, Eva Braun, married that night and a few hours later took their own lives.

What is more disquieting is that the attack was carried out following an incident involving two girls who were allegedly mocked by the victim. The matter was resolved by the proctor of the university.  
Media reports say Parvez and one of his friends had allegedly made passes at two girls who then called their boyfriends to come and settle the matter.
Reportedly, with the intervention of the university proctor, Parvez had asked for forgiveness and the matter was resolved.
Some time later, a group armed with knives, swooped in on Parvez, stabbing him indiscriminately.
The CCTV footage, already aired by several TV channels, show the visceral stabbings.
Parvez was declared dead at the hospital while several individuals involved in the mindless attack are now in police custody.
UNDERSTANDING A DISTURBED YOUTH CULTURE
The whole incident underlines the rise of a vicious culture among the young.
It‚Äôs natural that if a woman feels humiliated or affronted, she may want to seek the help from her male family members, which may include the husband or a boyfriend.
The fact that the male friends of the girls came to the scene may also be interpreted positively.
Whether Parvez had made offensive gestures or not is not certain but even if we accept, for the sake of the argument, that he had done something unacceptable then the settlement by the proctor of the private university plus the apology to the girls would have been sufficient.
Why was it necessary to get a gang of armed youths to attack and kill?
The perpetrators will face the law as there‚Äôs a clarion call for exemplary punishment, although punitive measures alone won‚Äôt allow us to get deeper into the sordid sub layers of youth culture, where violence, creating fear and muscle power are seen as the ultimate solution to all problems.
If there had been a verbal apology to the girls then there was no reason for the attack.
Sanowar Hossain, a sociologist, says: ‚ÄúThe problem lies in the very fragile sense of ego among the young. They tend to feel that without a show of force, their image would erode away and, in case of women being involved, their macho appeal must be upheld at all costs.‚Äù
A few weeks ago, during the last period of Ramadan, another incident triggered a social outcry although no life was lost.
A young female journalist and her younger brother were subject to abuse and physical assault as they protested indecent behaviour from a group of men.
What began as a minor argument could have ended with a little sense but the men in question became violent and ridiculed the victims as she identified herself as a journalist.
The saddest part is that the main accused, currently behind bars, also flaunted his media identity, saying he worked for a TV channel.
One media person misbehaving with another of the same profession in public is unfortunate.
They only demean the profession and themselves.  
Let‚Äôs bring into question the recent clashes of students of two prominent colleges of the city -- Dhaka College and City College.
This has become a regular phenomenon, though the incident triggering these ego-driven skirmishes is often trivial.
Perhaps it was an altercation over who gets precedence at a tea stall or a scuffle while entering public transport or an indiscreet comment ridiculing an academic entity.
In all of these cases, the perceived damage to one‚Äôs prestige is the driving force for a frenzied reaction.
In life, there are many events, which can make us feel offended.
While submitting to rage is one way, there are other, more subtle and less damaging ways to handle them.
Regrettably, at the heat of the moment, reason becomes blurred.
TWO GIRLS IN SPOTLIGHT
In the killing of Parvez, the alleged teasing of the two girls has been mentioned as the root of the fatal stabbing.
The girls, students from an academic institution in the city -- University of Scholars, have not been traced as of yet, though statements from them will be needed to ascertain as to what actually happened and why, even after an apology, the attack took place.
It may be possible that the second fatal attack was carried out without them knowing.
However, goading boyfriends coming back later to retaliate cannot be ruled out either.
To digress a bit, this tragic death signals an immediate need to crackdown on youth based gangs around the capital.
While establishing dominance in certain areas (turf dominance) is the key motivation of youth groups, they are also the conduit for narcotics.
Certain areas have seen a surge of such groups with residents urging action from the defence forces.
‚ÄúA clean up drive led by the members of the army, navy and air force and supported by the police can bring results,‚Äù says Mazhar, a TV journalist.
A man defending the honour of his lady has been the staple of fiction for centuries with popular culture extolling knights in shining armour.
The knight deserves applause, no doubt, although the lesson ought to be: don‚Äôt unsheathe the sword, if sensible dialogue can defuse a situation.

 US markets‚Äô crisis point hinges on a triple threat ,"
                        
                        
                        A selloff in US stocks, long-term government bonds and the dollar clearly traces back to policy choices by President Donald Trump's administration. Recent moves spawn a trio of worries: first, that a trade war will hit business and destabilise the United States' role in the world; second, that a $4.5 trillion tax cut plan could explode an already-historic fiscal deficit; and, finally, that pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could warp monetary policy. Trump has not yet forced an irrevocable break, but cracks are spreading at an alarming pace.

Investors are piling into short-term US debt even as longer-term Treasuries sell off, a potential sign of hesitancy to bear the risk of erratic policy shifts. Yields on 20-year bonds topped 4.9 percent on Monday. Similarly, cash is moving into non-US assets as the dollar tumbles.

It makes some sense: Trump has imposed, then partially lifted, tariffs of a magnitude not seen in over a century, sparking worries of a break with the global community. The consequences are slow to filter through into economic data, but early signs are arising. South Korean exports to the US tumbled 14 percent in Apr‚Äôs first 20 days from the year before, particularly hitting cars and parts.

The President places the onus on Powell, dubbing him ‚ÄúMr Too Late‚Äù for not lowering interest rates and warning that an economic slowdown could result. The Fed chair is clear that he prioritizes keeping price pressures anchored ‚Äî making any move unlikely as the public‚Äôs inflation expectations shift well above the Fed‚Äôs target.

Trump has pondered firing Powell, opens new tab in a legally uncertain maneuver that would threaten the independence safeguarding the central bank‚Äôs credibility, though advisers including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have pushed back, the Wall Street Journal reported. Even if that one pillar of economic management remains intact, though, Republicans‚Äô push for gigantic tax cuts is continuing, just as the US budget deficit has widened to a near-record $1.3 trillion in the six months since October.

Negotiations are underway to stanch the red ink with spending cuts or revenue. But the US sustains its fiscal profligacy thanks to international investors who treat Treasuries as the world‚Äôs risk-free asset. If they demand a meaningful risk premium, financing $36.6 trillion in national debt may become very expensive. With Trump pushing to bend monetary policy and the budget deficit potentially moving in the wrong direction, uncertainty is only rising.
Despite the gloom, US capital markets still have no clear substitute. An orderly transition when Powell‚Äôs term ends in 2026 could smooth institutional frictions. And tariff-reducing trade deals could ameliorate the worst of the economic damage. But the slowly creeping cracks point to weaknesses that could explode if any one policy move pushes to a critical point.

Long-term treasury yields climbed once again on Apr 21 after peaking earlier in the month, with 20-year Treasury yields rising above 4.9 percent.

President Donald Trump has leveled criticism at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, posting on social media that he should lower interest rates. Trump has discussed whether he could fire Powell before the end of his term in 2026, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The S&P 500 Index fell 2.8 percent by 12:30pm ET on Apr 21 amid a lack of progress towards agreements with US trading partners that would lower tariffs introduced earlier this month.
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Senate have started work on drafting a package to advance Trump‚Äôs legislative agenda, with debate beginning over spending cuts needed to offset the cost of extending and expanding tax cuts for individuals and businesses.

 Life 124 light-years away and they are not planning to attack Earth! (How boring) ,"
                        
                        
                        At last, the wait is over!
Centuries of speculation and fantasising about life out there in the vast universe have culminated with the recent telescopic sighting of what scientists are calling possible signs of living organisms in a planet, currently called K2-18 b.
Want to build a spacecraft and try to see for yourself! Er, well, it‚Äôs not right across the street by the way.
A little further down, say about 124 light years away!
With the most advanced craft available at the moment, the time needed to reach this planet will be 194,000 years.
Not your Barir Kache Arshi Nagar!
However, if any of your friends has access to a craft capable of warp dives then go right ahead.
Or, perhaps you might want to write a letter to the highly secured United States Air Force facility, Area 51, with the subject line saying: urgently need one of those alien space ships which crashed on Earth and has been restored by you!

PLANET WITH AN OCEAN

From what we have been told, the planet has a large ocean, which may house organisms.
I know, the image of hydra-headed monsters comes to mind.
How about moss-like organisms with a very short life span!
Does not sound that exciting enough, right?
The problem is, human imagination, with about a hundred years of relentless science fiction material, has influenced us in such a way that the word alien immediately conjures up sequences with spacecraft, hideous-looking creatures, strange language and evil designs to conquer Earth.
Instead, think this: a cold, isolated, distant planet with microbial life forms and nothing else?
Reality is far more banal, although we may not want to accept it.
The planet, which is now under the spotlight, may not have any other signs of life but that is hardly a fact to stifle our imagination.
If there is an ocean and some life, then it is just possible that billions of years ago, some life form existed there.
Perhaps, this was once used as an outpost by an alien civilisation!
The possibilities are countless!
One sci-fi enthusiast I know comes up with this delicious theory: ‚ÄúThe current life form was deliberately shown by some alien intelligence either to divert our attention or just as a prank! After all, we can‚Äôt get to it anytime soon.‚Äù
True that, a bit like: Parle Amare Dhor, or catch me if you can!
An alien life two hundred thousand years away sends a message to Earth about a missing craft, which crash landed here one billion years ago, carrying a fascinating cargo ‚Äì now that could be the premise for a Hollywood blockbuster.  
Do not have the cash for a film? Write a short story instead.
 

WHY IS LIFE ON ANOTHER PLANET SO IMPORTANT?

From the buzz this latest discovery has created, one may very well think that finding life far away has a significant impact on our existence now.
If this had been the height of the Cold War, we could have accepted that rationale because in the fierce clash between two separate ideologies, it was imperative to use scientific achievement as a means to demand legitimacy or glorification for a specific doctrine.
The moon landing was celebrated as a feat for mankind, with Capitalist technology triumphing over the Communist one.
By the way, one conspiracy theory suggests the 1969 moon landing was a hoax and done in a studio, just to one up the Russians.
Watch Capricorn One, the 1977 film, using this idea as the premise.
While the West still focuses a lot on space exploration with talks about Mars landing gaining traction under the new US government, the cold war time competition to reach for the skies has diminished.
While no one is looking for unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or vast alien civilisations, at the back of our heads, most thinking humans do find time to reflect on the question: what if, just what if, there is something out there, no matter how far!  
It is just our curiosity and the desire to discover something new that drives the unending quest to find something amazing out there.
Today, landing humans on Mars still seems like a tall order, two thousand years later, man could be having the World Cup football on the red planet.
The apt tagline could be: the biggest sporting event which is out of this world!
 

THE ‚ÄòANCIENT ALIEN‚Äô THEORY
 

In the 70s, in the hugely popular book called Chariots of the Gods, writer and researcher Erich Von Daniken claimed ‚Äî using artefacts and OOPARTs (Out of Place Artefacts) ‚Äî that highly advanced extraterrestrials visited Earth when this planet was still a savage place, roamed by mighty creatures.
His book suggests these aliens were worshipped by primitive humans as Gods, who then sketched them on cave walls and pyramid-like structures.
One school of thought theorises that the notion of Greek and Roman Gods originated from early human perception of aliens who used spacecraft, fought with laser-powered guns and lived on a heavenly abode called Olympus, which was not a mountain but a large space ship made to look like a mountain.
True or not, the ancient alien theory was used as a premise for the hugely acclaimed 2012 film Prometheus.
Since documents of human civilisation of the ancient period are scarce, the mere idea that life from other planets came here to live for a few thousand years only to leave when human civilisation became intelligent, often appears intriguing.
This concept further speculates that aliens left Earth and went to live somewhere else.
Could the new planet so far away provide any clue to add credibility to such a concept?
Point is, even if extraterrestrials had visited Earth then they have managed to stay elusive so far and there is no reason why they should reveal themselves now.
Thinking a little deeply, I have come to this conclusion: that mankind should keep on searching for aliens and never find a true intelligent race elsewhere is perhaps for our own good.
We will find a tantalising glimpse of some very primitive life form and nothing more.
Otherwise, the great mystery of life may just be solved!
Scientists contend that solid proof of some life form on K2-18 b will be found in two years.
By the way, that name is so unoriginal!
Since it is supposed to have an ocean, ‚ÄúPoseidon K2‚Äù can be a better option.
In the meantime, the science fiction juggernaut will keep on rolling out countless fascinating possibilities.
Enough said, time to watch Planet of the Vampires ‚Äì the 1965 cult film where female astronauts don the 60s daring leather jumpsuits and fight demons on a doomed planet.

 Why one Eastern European country was slow to kick its Russian oil habit? ,"
                        
                        
                        Czechia has the infrastructure, reserves, and access to alternative suppliers to eliminate its Russian oil imports. Yet, three years into Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Czech Republic continued to delay this strategic shift, despite the availability of viable alternatives.

In 2024, Czechia imported 2.7 million tonnes of Russian crude oil, worth an estimated 1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion), according to a recent analysis by the Center for the Study of Democracy. Although this is a 30 percent decrease in volume compared to 2023, the cut was not due to a proactive policy to phase out Russian crude but largely the result of three major disruptions to the Druzhba pipeline.

The completion of the Trans-Alpine (TAL) pipeline expansion at the end of 2024 should have enabled Czechia to fully replace Russian crude. However, as of February, the state-owned pipeline operator MERO ƒåR and the dominant refiner Orlen Unipetrol had yet to fully utilize this new resource. As a result, more than 100 million euros continued to flow to the Kremlin each month.

This delay is not due to technical constraints. Even prior to the final certification of the TAL-plus project, MERO ƒåR confirmed that spare capacity in the pipeline was sufficient to meet Czechia‚Äôs total annual crude demand.

Additionally, the country‚Äôs strategic reserves of 3.6 million tonnes could cover nearly half of its annual consumption. Nevertheless, Russian oil imports surged by 30 percent year-on-year in the final quarter of 2024, reaching 970,000 tonnes, the highest quarterly volume since the European Union's oil embargo took effect in 2022. The trend continued in 2025, with Czechia purchasing an additional 220,000 tonnes of Russian crude.

Orlen Unipetrol says that long-term contractual obligations with Rosneft, expiring in mid-2025, prevented an immediate exit from Russian supply. However, it is not clear that this is necessarily the case. For one, take-or-pay clauses ‚Äì often cited as justification ‚Äì are rare in global oil trade, where supply flexibility is the norm.

Orlen‚Äôs reluctance appears to have been primarily driven by financial concerns, as Russian crude was around 20 percent cheaper than Azeri crude on average in 2023 and 2024. Yet retail fuel prices remained stable during this time, with gasoline and diesel averaging between 1,500 and 1,360 euros per tonne, respectively. Orlen Unipetrol was therefore able to capitalize on the cost differential, reporting EBITDA exceeding 600 million euros annually during the peak years of Russian crude reliance.

Looking forward, the discount on Russian crude may widen further, as the widespread tariffs recently imposed by the US administration could dampen global oil demand, forcing Russia to slash prices.

REPERCUSSIONS

This passive approach has had significant geopolitical repercussions. Since the onset of the war, Czechia‚Äôs crude oil imports have contributed nearly 3 billion euros in tax revenues to the Russian state. In total, Czechia has spent 8.4 billion euros on Russian oil and gas since February 2022, more than six times the 1.32 billion euros it has provided in aid to Ukraine.

Additionally, Czechia continues to import refined oil products from Slovakia and Hungary, where refineries process Russian crude under an extended EU exemption until June 2025. In 2024, Slovakia exported 710,000 tonnes of fuel to Czechia, worth 520 million euros, despite the availability of alternatives. Germany, for instance, offers gasoline and diesel at only a 6‚Äì7 percent premium compared to Slovak suppliers.

Czechia‚Äôs natural gas imports also show a similar pattern. In anticipation of Ukraine‚Äôs termination of Russian gas transit in January 2025, Czechia increased its Russian gas purchases by nearly 400 percent in 2024. In the final quarter of 2024 alone, monthly imports surged to 0.34 billion cubic meters, 62 percent higher than the average for the rest of the year.

In short, the Czech government has the power to unilaterally ban Russian crude oil imports, halt purchases of fuels refined from Russian oil in Slovakia and Hungary, and make full use of the TAL pipeline and domestic reserves.

Bulgaria has already shown a complete Russian oil phase-out is possible. Sofia terminated its own exemption in early 2024, invoking a force majeure clause and cutting off Russian crude overnight. This led to neither oil supply security risks nor to an increase in domestic fuel prices despite the fact that Bulgaria relied on Russian oil for around 90 percent of its crude imports in 2023.

Czech government officials on Apr 17 said that the country has become fully independent of Russian oil supplies following completion of capacity upgrades on the TAL pipeline.

It appears that Czechia can align its actions with European energy security imperatives without severe economic repercussions, so if the current halt in Russian oil imports does not hold, it may struggle to justify why it is not doing so.

 Tearjerker films and novels: our obsession with sadness as solace! ,"
                        
                        
                        The West has stopped making movies with bleak endings some time ago. 

In short, protagonists do not die or end up losing the love interest and the audience do not leave the theatre with a grim face or moist eyes. 

This is because the word ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù has evolved quite a lot to solely mean relief, elation and joviality.

One goes to the cinema or cuddles up with a book not to end up feeling desolate, but to be revived. 

That is perhaps the reason why there has been a surge of Hollywood super hero films in recent times. 

A total escape from the drudgery of reality and getting lost in fantasy. 


Evil is pulverised, and the decent have reason to feel optimistic because, out there in this mean world, someone with special powers is ready to come to their aid.

Add in a few romantic lines, mind-blowing action and there you have it ‚Äì a recipe for a runaway success!

However, in Bangladesh, the word entertainment is still laced with sorrow, meaning, we get loads of movies or books where the protagonist dies or the lovers are separated, creating an atmosphere of doom and despondence. 

In written fiction, shattering readers‚Äô hearts with a tragedy is still a major motivation for writers.  

Somehow, we cannot get ‚Äútragedy‚Äù out of our system! 

If Shakespeare was around, he would be amazed to see the Romeo and Juliet impact surviving with such a vengeance among Bangladeshis. 

Notice, I did not say South Asia because other countries have moved on from the tear-jerking format. 

This Eid, of the top three movies, two saw the main characters bite the dust, although there was no need to plunge the audience into misery. 

‚ÄúHey, relax, it‚Äôs just a movie,‚Äù one of my friends told me and I realised that in half an hour we would be forgetting it. 

But then, while sipping the post movie tea, this obsession with death, tragedy and separation in fiction kept nagging me. 


DESOLATION SYNDROME WOVEN INTO THE SOCIAL CREED


The desire to end entertainment with death or separation stems from the belief that sad endings make a lasting mark while happy ones do not. 

Someone once told me, if Juliet had not taken the death-feigning potion and Romeo had not killed himself believing that his love had died, no one would have remembered the play. 

Really? 

Actually, after reading the play, I thought: ‚Äúimpetuous fools! This could have been planned better!‚Äù

If memory serves me correctly, in the mid 80s, the immensely popular BTV drama, Eishob Dinratri brought the issue of the tragic ending to the fore because Tuni, a child character, was heading to her death at the end of the series. 

The series began at a time when the middle-class struggle all across the country had a homogeneous feel since the majority of families had to face the same socio-economic hurdles. 

In the decade after liberation, life in Bangladesh was all about overcoming impediments and making the best with what was available. 

While the choices were limited, the success of being content with whatever we had was actually impressive. 

Anyway, the audience of Eishob Dinratri, anticipating the ominous ending, demanded Tuni be saved by some medical intervention or miracle. 

The writer, the renowned Humayun Ahmed, reportedly did not listen to any suggestion.

The grim reaper was not diverted!

Entertainment ended with death and stifled tears.

The same happened in another early 90s BTV series, Kothao Keu Nei, where the character, Baker Bhai, a charming rogue, is sentenced to death for a murder in which he was falsely implicated. 

Over the course of the television series, Baker Bhai, won millions of hearts with his gangster like dialogue and appearance but a solid ethical moral stand. 

Naturally, when it became clear that he would be walking the gallows, protests erupted. 

If the objection to the death in Eishob Dinratri was limited to civil comments then this time, there was a nationwide backlash with people bringing out rallies demanding Baker Bhai be saved in the last episode by a presidential pardon. 

Nope, the writer was adamant to kill him, and so, there was another tragic ending with the female protagonist waiting like a living dead at the jail gate to receive the lifeless body.

The nation wept, we avoided seeing the last bit and as far as I remember, the writer reportedly avoided public appearances for some time.  

The episodes of Kothao Keu Nei can be found on You Tube but as far as I know, most viewers never watch the last one. 

Pointless tragedy, I should say!

In reality, unless someone‚Äôs role is definitively proved in a murder, the verdict of death is avoided.

Even if a death sentence is given, for a large number of cases, the original sentence is eventually commuted to life imprisonment. 

Naturally, for a fictional work, the ending has to be dramatic or something that gives a jolt, triggering a feeling of despair plus a prolonged period of speculation, marked by a whole lot of ‚Äúifs‚Äù and ‚Äúcould haves‚Äù. 

The tendency to revel in desolation became a driving force for the band music revolution of the 80s when hit songs of most bands dealt with the pining of the jilted lover. 

ENOUGH TEARS, LET‚ÄôS LAUGH A BIT!
Do readers and movie-goers want a grim ending? I do not think so! 

The time when sadness was a pleasurable past time is gone.

By the way, film makers, writers can always choose the ‚Äúalternative ending‚Äù option if they do not want to compromise on the original plot. 

If people opt for the ending with a positive note over the ending with death and separation then the message will be very clear. 

There is a famous Kolkata short film made twice by Sandwip Ray, called Bateshwarer Abodan, where a writer, determined to kill off a main character in a popular story being serialised in a magazine, is faced with a series of puzzling incidents. 

Watch it and you will want to watch it several times. 

The message in the film is something I leave for you to find out. 

To be honest, life itself, despite a plethora of creature comforts and an increased income, still has too many low moments. 

Hence, entertainment should be just that ‚Äì a few hours of unvarnished, sometimes unrealistic pleasure.

In the end, people should come out feeling refreshed, reinvigorated and with a smile. 

If Shakespeare re-wrote Romeo and Juliet in 2025 against a Bangladeshi setting, then he would have arranged for a WhatsApp strategy between the lovers. 

How is this for an ending: Juliet wakes up, finding Romeo by her side and they make a run for it in a car belonging to a mutual friend. 

And the last scene can be a sizzling dance scene with a modern rendition of Tumi jekhane Ami Shekhane!

Tragedy, take a hike!

 Beyond the roar of the crowd: A Bangladeshi cyclist finds a silent kinship in Argentine Patagonia ,"
                        
                        
                        Ask any Bangladeshi about Argentina, and the conversation will likely erupt into a passionate debate about Maradona‚Äôs divine hand or Messi‚Äôs magical feet. Football, tango, the vibrant architecture of Buenos Aires ‚Äì these are the images that dance in our collective imagination. But my journey, a solitary pedal through the vast, windswept plains of Patagonia, unveiled a different Argentina, a hushed landscape that resonated with a quiet familiarity deep within my Bangladeshi soul.


I‚Äôd set off, truth be told, half-expecting a country where the echoes of stadium cheers vibrated through the very air. Instead, Patagonia swallowed the noise. This sprawling region, a dramatic tapestry of southern Argentina and Chile, hummed with a profound silence. The majestic Andes Mountains, their snow-capped peaks piercing the endless sky, stood like stoic, watchful guardians. Before me, straight, empty roads unspooled into the horizon, flanked by stark, rocky deserts that stretched further than my Dhaka-accustomed eyes could comprehend. There were no roaring crowds, no triumphant goals ‚Äì just the persistent flutter of the little Bangladeshi flag attached to my bicycle, a stubborn, comforting reminder of the green and gold of home.


San Carlos de Bariloche, a charming mountain town that felt plucked straight from a Swiss postcard, was a deceptive gateway. Nestled amidst the towering Andes and fringed by glacial lakes of an impossible blue, it‚Äôs often dubbed Argentina‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittle Switzerland.‚Äù Here, picture-perfect cabins dotted the hillsides, and tourists bustle, eager for a taste of skiing or the rich local chocolate. My bicycling journey begun here with my Argentinian friend Tadeo and ended at the provincial capital of Rio Negro, Viedma, the eastern side of Argentina. But pedal further, venture deeper into Patagonia‚Äôs embrace, and the scenery undergoes a stark transformation. The lush greenery surrenders to bone-dry plains that suddenly give way to unexpected stretches of windswept grasslands. And the wind ‚Äì ah, the wind! It became my constant companion, pushing, pulling, and persisting with the relentless energy of a Kalboishakhi storm back home, testing my resolve with every gust.


At times, the sheer solitude was almost a tangible presence, a heavy blanket of quiet that settled around me. Days would drift by without the sight of another human being, only the curious gaze of farmed cows or sheep ‚Äì and the occasional rumbling truck whose driver might offer a brief wave before disappearing into the vast emptiness. In those moments, the only voice I heard was the whisper of the wind and the rhythmic whir of my bicycle wheels.

I had tied the Bangladeshi flag to the back of my bicycle. I thought someone might stop and ask, ‚ÄúWhere is that flag from?‚Äù But nothing like that happened. A few bikers, some truck drivers did glance at me, some even waved. The only car that actually stopped to talk belonged to a Canadian tourist. And at that moment, I was reminded‚Äîback in 2014, I had crossed Canada myself on a tandem bicycle. In that instant, it became clear‚Äîsame flag, two continents, two very different reactions.


In the remote, sparsely populated villages, where finding lodging felt like a minor miracle, the inherent kindness of the Argentine people shone through. In Clemente Onelli, where guesthouses were nonexistent, the local school opened its doors to me. Fifteen pairs of wide, curious eyes absorbed my hesitant tales of Bangladesh‚Äôs mighty rivers and the how to count 1 to 10 in Bangla. In the back of the room, a tattooed Indigenous man, a quiet testament to Argentina‚Äôs often-overlooked multiculturalism, nodded slowly, his gaze filled with a quiet understanding that transcended words.


Argentine kindness, I discovered, possesses a quiet humility, a gentle echo of our own deeply ingrained ‚ÄúAtithi‚Äù is our close relative ‚Äì the belief that a guest is akin to a god. When a bus driver, bound by regulations, reluctantly refused to take my bike, Claudia, Celso and their friend Christina - complete strangers - spontaneously offered their help. They carefully loaded my trusty steed into their car, drove out of their way, and as they bid me farewell, they pressed a small Argentine flag into my hand. ‚ÄúFor your next adventure,‚Äù they said, their smiles genuine and warm.
Patagonia‚Äôs beauty is not the lush, vibrant green of our Bengal delta; it‚Äôs a stark, resilient beauty forged in harshness. Days often meant battling blinding dust storms that swirled like desert demons, enduring icy winds that bit at exposed skin, and facing a sun so fierce it felt like the relentless heat of a Dhaka summer. Unlike home, where a comforting tea stall appears every half-kilometre, survival here demanded meticulous planning, careful rationing of precious water, and a constant, fervent prayer for the fleeting shade of a lonely outcrop.


Yet, this raw, untamed emptiness also cultivated a profound sense of resilience within me. The starkness of the landscape mirrored a quiet strength in the people who called this land home. Villages like Comallo, where century-old steam trains still chug along weathered tracks, felt like stepping onto a film set, history breathing in the present moment, a testament to enduring spirit.
In Viedma, a town holding a small piece of Bangladeshi sporting history ‚Äì it‚Äôs where our national football team captain, Jamal Bhuiyan, once played ‚Äì I harbored a secret hope for a familiar taste of home, a connection to my roots. Instead, I found quiet, unassuming streets. But even in this apparent lack of familiarity, I sensed subtle signs of a growing connection. Argentina had reopened its embassy in Dhaka in 2023, a quiet nod to burgeoning ties between our distant nations. On social media, I saw the digital bridge being built, Bangladeshis now passionately debating the merits of Messi versus Maradona, while Argentine fans, intrigued by this faraway land, were discovering the rich flavors of our tehari and the fervent passion of our cricket craze.

 
So, to my fellow Bangladeshi wanderers, those with a restless spirit and a yearning to explore beyond the familiar: Argentina is not Europe with its easily navigable tourist trails but indeed you will find eurocentrism. Its hospitality is often understated, its landscapes can be unforgiving, demanding respect and resilience. But beneath the rugged exterior, its heart beats with the same quiet courage I see in our farmers toiling in the fields or the stoic nouka sailors navigating our mighty rivers. Carry the warmth of our Bangladeshi spirit with you; you will find it echoed, softly, in the vast shadows of the Andes, in the unexpected kindness of strangers, in the shared human experience of navigating a challenging world.


As I pedaled past Patagonia‚Äôs seemingly endless horizons, the wind at my back and the setting sun painting the sky in fiery hues, I realized that borders, those lines drawn on maps, begin to fade when curiosity takes the lead. After all, isn‚Äôt that the very spirit of Bangladesh too? A land that, with a simple invitation for a cup of cha, has the remarkable ability to turn strangers into family. And in the silent grandeur of Patagonia, I found a distant echo of that very same human connection, a quiet kinship forged in solitude and the shared language of the open road.

Adios Argentina!

 Why Bangladesh needs Alternative Dispute Resolution ,"
                        
                        
                        The term ADR means ‚ÄúAlternative Dispute Resolution‚Äù, which are methods used to resolve conflicts that do not rely on court proceedings. These can involve arbitration, mediation, negotiation, and a number of other avenues.

ADR is growing in significance worldwide. But despite elements traceable as far back as the Family Courts Ordinance of 1985 and the milestone adoption of the Arbitration Act of 2001, people in Bangladesh do not properly comprehend the idea of ADR.

But why is ADR necessary?

To begin with, ADR is the cost-friendly option as it is associated with lower legal fees. Since parties avoid court litigation, a huge sum of money is saved. Usually, parties going for ADR fully settle their issues, so there is no chance of appeal, hence tamping down on escalating costs.

ADR services like mediation, arbitration, and negotiation are very time-friendly compared to litigation since a settlement can be reached quickly. Because ADR also has a smaller number of procedural delays, and these methods also provide flexibility.

ADR maintains confidentiality and privacy, providing protection to secret and sensitive information of the parties. For example, if a large business implements ADR like arbitration, their trade secrets will be protected as a result, and both their corporate and personal reputations are safeguarded.

Unlike the hectic procedure of court litigation, ADR services also provide a more relaxed environment for the parties that ensures emotional well-being. Moreover, when a party goes through court litigation, the ruling of the court can be damaging for one party; however, ADR is focused on a win-win situation for both parties when resolving a dispute, causing minimal damage to both parties and saving their reputation in the long run.

ADR also reduces the excess number of cases that go for litigation, which reduces the courts‚Äô caseloads.

Despite these benefits, only a few businesses, certain legal professionals, and a handful of institutions know about ADR in Bangladesh. This means that when they run into conflict, they run to court litigation.

Despite formal acknowledgement of ADR in Bangladesh via the Arbitration Act 2001 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003, it still lacks institutional promotion. Bangladeshis do not know about any well-established ADR centres, which restricts the implementation of ADR services like arbitration and mediation. Few initiatives are taken to establish or expand such centres. The Bangladesh International Arbitration Centre (BIAC) established in 2011 is not known to many and remains underutilised.

Another issue is that the litigators of Bangladesh do not communicate with clients about ADR. This is because a lot of the lawyers themselves do not know about the advantages of ADR or do not fully understand the potential of it or do not talk about it openly due to lack of incentives.

As they do not know much about ADR, they are also less likely to trust it, worrying that their complaints will not be taken seriously.

A further issue is that the provisions in the Arbitration Act 2001 and the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 2003 lack appropriate enforcement, as there is no proper body in Bangladesh that maintains proper regulations of ADR services, decreasing the efficiency of such services and leading towards persistent delays.

But this does not mean that ADR could not become a central part of conflict resolution in Bangladesh. It just needs the right promotion.

Firstly, a method should be used to promote ADR through the courts. A system similar to the pre-action protocol followed by the UK can be instituted for this purpose.

In the UK, before commencing litigation, both parties have to follow the pre-action protocol. During this process, courts highly recommend ADR, like arbitration. If a party skips ADR unnecessarily, they get penalised by the court later. If something similar is introduced in Bangladesh it will help make the concept more familiar to the public, allow them to see its benefits, and increase their trust in the process.

The Bangladesh Bar Council can also counter the lack of awareness about ADR. They can create a training certification programme for lawyers on the topic and integrate it into bar examinations. Lawyers in training can have ADR added to their LLB programme, which has already been done in many parts of India. Performance-based fees can also be introduced regarding ADR so lawyers overcome any stigma against it.

The ADR enforcement issue can be handled through a strong regulatory body. This body can not only set and develop rules and regulations it can also ensure and improve transparency in the process.

Countries that utilise ADR as a key system can also collaborate and develop strategies together by putting together a platform that promotes ADR services and allows specialists to share their experiences. This could be highly beneficial for growth in international commerce and business, which often prefers ADR services due to global enforceability and it being both time and cost-friendly.

Finally, the application of ADR in Bangladesh also upholds the Constitution. The preamble to the Constitution says that Bangladesh believes in the rule of law and access to justice for all its citizens. In addition, Article 27 ensures equality before the law and Article 35 notes trials and punishments. The implementation of ADR would also push forward these fundamental principles of ensuring and safeguarding justice.

Currently, around 4.2 million lawsuits are pending in Bangladesh‚Äôs courts. This puts substantial pressure on the legal system. Justice is not served in a timely manner. And, as William Gladstone said: ‚ÄúJustice delayed is justice denied.‚Äù

Like Bangladesh, Italy was also facing a massive backlog of 5.4 million pending cases in 2010-2011. In response, the government made mediation mandatory through a decree in 2010. Despite some initial resistance, the policy has had some success, with thousands of cases being resolved through mediation since March 2011. There has also been positive outcomes in Canada since it implemented ADR throughout the 1980s and 1990s following the Hryniak v Mauldin case that acknowledged new adjudication methods. Bangladesh does not have to go as far as making ADR mandatory outright, but it could prove a useful support for the existing legal system.

Introducing ADR to a broader audience in Bangladesh may not be as smooth a process as we hope. There will, inevitably, be stumbling blocks. But that does not mean that it is not worth doing. As Kenneth Cloke, founder of Mediation Beyond Borders International, says: no new world is created without disorder. Bangladesh‚Äôs legal system has gone through many growing pains over the past 50 years. Now it is time to heal by properly integrating innovative approaches like ADR and securing our future.

 Eid movies divide masala bonanza and the intellectual treat! ,"
                        
                        
                        Here are two contrasting scenes from the Eid celluloid treat, 2025: 

Scene one: In an underground parking lot, the debonair protagonist, Ariyan Mirza smells danger as he is about to get inside his Rolls Royce with the lady in question. 

Soon, surrounded by thugs, the hero puts the girl inside the car and unleashes hell on the villains, shooting, maiming, breaking bones and using the hand held axe snatched from one of the assailants to inflict terrible injuries. 

As a dozen men lay groaning or dead, the man of the moment sits atop his car bonnet, shushing everyone to be silent. 

The crowd goes wild, the clapping is accompanied by cheers. 

The King of commercial films Shakib Khan has come back with another blockbuster called Borbaad.

Death, destruction, dance and drinks have the audience intoxicated! 

Scene two: A teenager with multiple stab wounds lay dead in a pool of blood in a city apartment, police have cordoned off the crime scene while a bevy of media cameras and reporters wait outside, waiting to get a comment. 

On the way is detective inspector Moinul. 

Pot-bellied, unassuming and wearing simple clothes, his outdated motorbike refuses the start but Moinul is persistent. 

While trying desperately to kick start the machine, his sidekick, a young sub-inspector, comes in on a swanky bike. 

In the end, no miracles happen and the inspector leaves his machine behind, taking a ride with his partner to the crime scene, holding a packet of nuts. 

The only thing giving away his identity is the side arm, firmly placed inside the holster.

At the scene, the blood does not bother him and neither does he make any extravagant promises to nab the criminal. 

Methodically, he tries to look for clues or something out of the ordinary, gazing intently at the cigarette butts, where one half smoked stick is different than the others. 

People at the Cineplex get ready for an intellectually stimulating thriller in Chokkor 302. 

CELLULOID ESCAPISM SANS REASON 

Two completely different scenes introducing two main characters.

Both films illustrate the celluloid dichotomy this Eid-ul-Fitr. 

Understandably, when several movies are released simultaneously, there is always competition to be the top. 

During Eid, this race becomes intense as millions of people all over Bangladesh now go to cinema halls and swanky Cineplex theatres to relax, unwind and enjoy. 

The last 10 years have seen a marked surge in movie going, especially during religious holidays. 

The main pull factor has been the modern Cineplex theatres with food courts, playing area and other entertainment.  

The traditional dinner and a movie has metamorphosed somewhat to become the ‚Äúfilm and a pizza‚Äù treat. 

This transformation in movie watching has brought back the educated middle class who are coming in droves for that spectacular celluloid escapism. 

The trend of choosing the film tells one a lot about what people want to see. 

The first scene mentioned at the top was from the currently running super hit Borbaad, starring Shakib. 

Not surprising, all shows are booked for 48 hours and tickets are much in demand. 

This follows a total commercial movie formula: opulent sets, posh cars, sumptuous clothes, crown maddening item songs, layered with unlimited swagger and bravado. 

There is hardly any logic, reason has gone for a long holiday and inconsistencies are too many. 

However, the purpose is simple: Provide a completely crowd pleasing film where reality is overtaken by fantasy. 

The aim of such productions is to trigger wild excitement and a rush of post film watching euphoria. 

Think about the earlier Shakib movie Toofan and all will be clear. 

When asked why the Shakib starred Borbaad is seeing houseful at all shows, owner of Modhumita Cinema Hall, Ifekharuddin Naushad, said: ‚ÄúOver the years, a Shakib fan base has developed and this multiplied with Toofan, the commercial flick which was just as boisterous and ostentatious as the Shahrukh Khan hit Pathaan.‚Äù  

He added that improvements in filmmaking techniques and the use of state of the art technology have also played a key role.

However, a young fan of Shakib has a different take on the reason for such a craze.

‚ÄúShakib Khan has become more mature in his dialogue and the romantic (effeminate) hero look is overtaken by a mean, cold expression which the young find appealing.‚Äù 

He has lost weight and can now move and dance gracefully while his on screen persona has become more charismatic, added a lady admirer. 

For quite sometime, Shakib has been playing the badass underground ‚Äúuber cool‚Äù gangster ‚Äì a trend that has struck a chord with the audience, especially the young. 

Rakib Uddin, a social science expert, says: ‚ÄúIn our sub conscious mind, there‚Äôs always a fascination about the life of gangsters and much of that idea has been formed by Western movies like Scarface, Heat, God Father, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Carlito‚Äôs Way. 

That concept, although mostly driven by fiction, has seeped into films of the sub continent, blending with purely South Asian celluloid features like dance, melodrama etc.‚Äù   

For extra piquancy, all gangsters in our movies must be able to deliver flamboyant dialogue aimed at rousing the crowd, no matter how silly they may seem, he adds.
SOCIAL MESSAGES IN A CRIME THRILLER

Now let‚Äôs come to our second scene from the crime thriller Chokkor 302, made with a government grant. 

There have been many state-funded films in the past but this is possibly the first one, which is a thriller and not a social drama. 

One of the characteristics of films made with government financing is the presence of a social message, either about the struggle of a community or the general trials and tribulations unique to a certain period of time, said Rakib.

However, the downside of plain social drama is they do not have enough material or twists to hold the attention of the audience, he adds. 

‚ÄúCurrent movie goers want to be glued to the seat either for the extravagant treat or for an intriguing plot.‚Äù

This is where Chokkor 302 delivers and scores full points.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very intelligent move to make a crime thriller with veteran actors, deftly adding a relevant social message under its complex plot,‚Äù said Al Farhan, a film critic. 

Chokkor has a gripping story, the actors, all big names from the small screen, play their respective parts with conviction and, wait, there is a poignant social message ‚Äì moral decay under the veneer of urban glitz. 

Young smart youths sliding into drugs for a ‚Äúgood time‚Äù form the first layer of this urban rot with society overtaken by mercenary ideals creating the second. 

Wrapped in a spellbinding thriller plot, the film creates a contrast between decadence and simplicity. 
Two lines from Chokkor provide enough fodder for thought. 

The first is where Inspector Moinul, finding that a young girl who had an abortion and is nonchalant about it, asks in a shocked tone: ‚ÄúHow can people of your generation handle so many life related upheavals and remain so calm?‚Äù  

The deliberate failure of the young to grasp the ramifications or enormity of a mishap is highlighted here. 

The second line is where Moinul tells his sidekick: ‚ÄúI am in love with my wife; once you ‚Äòdecide‚Äô to be in love with your better half, life will be free of many unnecessary complexities.‚Äù 

Can not ignore the profound message in that, right?

" On this World Day for Physical Activity, stop sitting around ","
                        
                        
                        Sunday is World Physical Activity Day, a global initiative to promote the benefits of staying active. In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially designated Apr 6 to raise awareness about the importance of physical activity in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This global event encourages individuals, communities, and policymakers to prioritise physical activity as a fundamental pillar of well-being. While this day is celebrated worldwide, it holds particular significance for countries like Bangladesh, where rising physical inactivity and sedentary behaviours pose major public health concerns.

UNDERSTANDING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

Physical activity refers to any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. This broad definition includes activities performed during leisure time, active transportation (e.g., walking or cycling), occupational tasks, and household chores. Depending on intensity, physical activity can be classified as low, moderate, or vigorous. Moderate-intensity activities, such as brisk walking or casual cycling, elevate heart rate to 50-70 percent of its maximum, while vigorous activities, such as jogging or playing soccer, push heart rate up to 70-85 percent. Even low-intensity activities, like casual walking or doing household chores, contribute to overall health when performed regularly.

Exercise and sports are structured forms of physical activity designed to enhance fitness. Exercise includes activities like jogging, yoga, and weightlifting, while sports involve skill, competition, and teamwork, such as football, cricket, and swimming. While all sports and exercise fall under the umbrella of physical activity, not all physical activities qualify as structured exercise. Regardless of the type, engaging in regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good health.

IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

The WHO underscores that regular physical activity has profound benefits for physical, mental, and social health. It helps prevent and manage non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers. Additionally, it improves mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression while enhancing cognitive function and sleep quality. Among children and adolescents, physical activity supports healthy growth and development.



Beyond personal health benefits, physical activity contributes to broader societal goals. For instance, increased physical activity reduces reliance on motorized transportation, leading to improved air quality and safer urban environments. These outcomes align with the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to health, sustainable cities, and climate action. However, despite these well-documented benefits, global levels of physical activity remain insufficient. WHO estimates that 27 percent of adults and over 80 percent of adolescents worldwide do not meet recommended activity levels.

RECOMMENDED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS

Physical activity recommendations vary across age groups:

Children and Adolescents (5-17 years): At least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily, with muscle- and bone-strengthening exercises at least three times a week.
Adults (18-64 years): At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week, combined with muscle-strengthening exercises on two or more days a week.
Older Adults (65+ years): The same guidelines as adults, with added emphasis on balance and strength training to prevent falls.
Pregnant and Postpartum Women: At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, with adjustments based on individual health status.
Individuals with Chronic Conditions or Disabilities: Physical activity should be adapted to individual abilities, with a goal of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.
Consulting healthcare professionals before making significant changes to an exercise routine is always advisable, particularly for those with underlying health conditions.



THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LANDSCAPE IN BANGLADESH

Bangladesh, like many other countries in the Global South, faces substantial challenges in promoting physical activity. The 2022 National STEPS Survey revealed that 19.5 percent of Bangladeshi adults are insufficiently active, with lower participation among women (14.6 percent) compared to men (23.9 percent). The WHO Bangladesh Physical Activity Profile (2022) further highlights gender disparities, with 16% of men and 40 percent of women not meeting activity guidelines. The situation is even more alarming among adolescents, with over 69 percent of girls and 63 percent of boys failing to achieve recommended activity levels. Additionally, a recent population-based study found that 50.3 percent of adolescent girls and 29 percent of adolescent boys were insufficiently active in Bangladesh. These figures highlight the urgent need for tailored interventions to encourage physical activity among all age groups in Bangladesh.

BARRIERS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

Promoting physical activity in Bangladesh faces several obstacles, ranging from environmental and infrastructural challenges to socio-cultural and economic barriers. Rapid urbanisation and unplanned development have significantly reduced access to open spaces, parks, and playgrounds, particularly in major cities like Dhaka and Chattogram. The lack of pedestrian-friendly pathways, combined with heavy traffic congestion and inadequate cycling lanes, discourages people from engaging in outdoor activities such as walking, jogging, or cycling. Additionally, poor air quality and extreme weather conditions, including high humidity and frequent heavy rains, further hinder regular outdoor exercise.

Socio-cultural norms also play a significant role in limiting physical activity, particularly for women. Traditional gender expectations often discourage women from engaging in outdoor exercise or sports, as there are few spaces designed to accommodate their needs safely. Safety concerns, including harassment, unsafe roads, and poor street lighting, further restrict their participation. Additionally, societal attitudes often prioritise academic and professional commitments over physical well-being, particularly among students and working professionals, leading to increasingly sedentary lifestyles.

Economic constraints add another layer of difficulty. Many people, especially those in low-income communities, lack access to affordable recreational facilities, gyms, or sports programs. Even when such facilities exist, they are often overcrowded, poorly maintained, or financially out of reach for a large portion of the population. Moreover, a lack of awareness about the benefits of physical activity means that many people do not prioritize movement in their daily routines. Schools often undervalue physical education, with academic pressures taking precedence over sports and recreational physical activities.

To overcome these barriers, a coordinated effort is needed to integrate physical activity into public health policies, urban planning, and community programs. Addressing these challenges will require investment in infrastructure, targeted awareness campaigns, and culturally inclusive approaches that encourage active lifestyles for all.

STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

Promoting physical activity in Bangladesh requires a comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach that integrates government policies, community initiatives, and individual efforts. One of the most critical steps is the development and enforcement of national policies that prioritise physical activity as a public health goal. This includes incorporating physical activity into urban planning by creating pedestrian-friendly pathways, cycling lanes, parks, and open spaces. Ensuring equitable access to these facilities in both urban and rural areas can encourage people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds to engage in regular physical activity. Additionally, infrastructure must be designed with inclusivity in mind, offering safe and accessible spaces for women, children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.

Raising awareness about the benefits of physical activity is another essential strategy. Nationwide campaigns using television, radio, social media, and community-based programs can effectively educate the public on the importance of regular movement. Schools should also play a vital role by integrating physical education into the curriculum, ensuring that students participate in daily exercise. Encouraging active commuting, such as walking or cycling to school, and organising extracurricular sports activities can help encouraging lifelong habits of physical activity in young people. Workplaces, too, can promote active lifestyles by incorporating movement-friendly policies, such as standing desks, wellness programs, and opportunities for physical activity during breaks. Developing national guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour with culturally relevant recommendations can raise awareness and encourage people to be more active while reducing sedentary lifestyles.

Community engagement is crucial for fostering a culture of physical activity. Organising local events such as walking groups, fitness classes, sports tournaments, and yoga sessions can provide social motivation and make exercise more enjoyable. Special programmes that address gender disparities‚Äîsuch as women-only fitness centres, female-friendly sports facilities, and awareness campaigns that challenge restrictive social norms‚Äîcan help increase participation among women. Additionally, leveraging technology through mobile apps, virtual fitness programs, and wearable devices can encourage people to monitor their physical activity levels and stay motivated.

Finally, partnerships and collaborations between government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private sector stakeholders, and international bodies can enhance the reach and impact of physical activity initiatives. Learning from successful global models and adapting them to Bangladesh‚Äôs unique context can lead to sustainable and effective programmes. Regular monitoring and evaluation of interventions will be essential to measure progress and ensure that strategies remain relevant and impactful. By taking a holistic approach, Bangladesh can foster an environment that supports and encourages physical activity, ultimately improving public health and overall well-being.

LOOKING AHEAD

World Physical Activity Day serves as a timely reminder of the critical role that physical activity plays in fostering individual and societal well-being. Bangladesh faces unique challenges in promoting physical activity, but through concerted efforts by policymakers, educators, community leaders, and individuals, an active lifestyle can become the norm rather than the exception. As we mark this occasion, let us commit to moving more, sitting less, and embracing physical activity as a lifelong habit. Together, we can create a healthier, more active future for Bangladesh.

 Don‚Äôt risk your future: The United States cracks down on illegal immigration ,"
                        
                        
                        To make America safe, strong, and prosperous, President Donald Trump is ensuring that US immigration laws are followed. If you try to enter the United States illegally, lie to get a visa, work without legal permission, or stay in the United States after your visa or visa waiver period expires, you will face serious penalties. These include jail time, deportation, and a permanent ban on obtaining a US visa in the future.
If you have family or friends who are in the United States illegally, now is the time to tell them to come home.
TRYING TO ENTER OR REMAIN ILLEGALLY WILL GET YOU CAUGHT
Some people believe they can sneak into the United States and avoid being caught. This is not true. The Trump administration has strengthened border security and greatly increased the number of illegal aliens being arrested and deported.
In February 2025, illegal border crossings dropped 94 percent compared to February 2024, while arrests of illegal border crossers inside the United States increased by 627 percent. If you try to cross a US border or remain in the United States illegally, you will be caught, detained, and sent back. You may also be banned from ever returning or face fines and criminal charges.
US VISA FRAUD HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
The US visa process is the most secure in the world. Yet, some people unwisely still try to cheat the system by using fake documents, lying on applications, or staying after their visa expires. These are examples of visa fraud, and it is a serious crime. If you break the law in this way, you will be punished, and you may never be allowed to enter the United States again.
THE JOURNEY TO THE US BORDER IS DANGEROUS
For those considering making the dangerous journey to illegally cross into the United States, understand that your safety ‚Äì and even your life ‚Äì are at risk. Criminal groups, cartels, and human traffickers target illegal migrants, subjecting them to violence, extortion, and assault. Many who attempt the journey never make it to their destination.
The United States is working with other countries in the Western Hemisphere to stop and return people trying to enter illegally before they even reach the US border. By securing our borders, we are not only protecting American citizens but also preventing the suffering caused by illegal immigration.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HOLDING EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE
The United States government is also taking action against those who help others enter the country illegally. This includes smugglers, human traffickers and even foreign government officials who allow illegal immigration to continue.
Recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa restriction policy for foreign officials ‚Äì including immigration, customs, and port authority staff ‚Äì who fail to help stop illegal immigration. This builds on similar existing restrictions for those in the transportation and tourism industries. Those who threaten US security by facilitating illegal immigration are not welcome in our country.
THE CHOICE IS CLEAR ‚Äì FOLLOW THE LAW
The risks of trying to illegally immigrate to the United States far outweigh any potential benefits. You could lose your life, become a victim of criminals, or end up with a record that damages your future and your family‚Äôs future.
Illegal entry not only breaks US laws, it also puts your safety and well-being in jeopardy. The penalties are serious: jail time, separation from your family, and permanent bans from re-entering the United States.
If you know someone who is in the United States illegally, the best thing you can do for them is encourage them to leave now before they are caught.
For everyone, the message is simple: Make the right choice, follow the law, and do not risk your safety, your family, or your future.

Well, for those who seek to learn about the finer things of life from music to books to poetry to the lost social creed of Bangladesh, the man to go to is definitely the writer par excellence: Hasnat Abdul Hye.
At 89, he is still on fire, the mind lucid like a 30-year-old, layered with inimitable wit and charm.
An adda with him is like a dive into a world of invaluable information about a wide variety of things, both legit and those a bit louche.
Trust me, as a writer of society and its countless intricate sub-layers, he is anything but a puritan.
Without thinking twice, called Hasnat Sir on messenger to see if he was free.
After prolonged ringing, the voice on the other side said in a hurried tone: ‚ÄúDear Towheed, I am giving a TV interview now, come over after an hour!‚Äù
Well, just let me tell you this, very few, and, I mean very few people can manage to take up time from my evenings, which are usually spent at the Dhaka University campus.
But for Hasnat Abdul Hye, rules can be broken!

A LIVING TIME CAPSULE

A common belief: nostalgia is woven into the human mind!
Whether we are mid aged or seniors or even just stepping into life‚Äôs vast arena of challenges, the past, or, the magnetism of the past become essential companions at times.
In a group or in solitude, the moments left behind hold a special allure.
This is where Hasnat Abdul Hye steps in.
As a writer, he is a percipient observer of the evolving trends of society, its intricate details, the neglected, the ignored and the forgotten.
As Sir keenly showed me his new possession, a latest Audio Zio briefcase turn table and enthusiastically put Italian coffee into the machine, I knew the evening would turn out to be special.
‚ÄúI bought this album from London in 1962,‚Äù said Sir, as he showed the now faded blue cover of Frank Sinatra‚Äôs album ‚ÄúPoint of No Return‚Äù.
But first, listen to my favourite, Moon River, sung by Connie Francis, he enthused.  
As the mesmerising voice filled the air, Moon River brought back memories of the film: Breakfast at Tiffany‚Äôs where Audrey Hepburn sang it.
Ahh, they do not make films and songs like that anymore, said the virtuoso writer wistfully.
Talking about movies and songs, Hasnat Abdul Hye alluded to Harry Belafonte, the famous singer, who also acted in the 1957 contentious but box office smasher film, Island in the Sun.
Just to refresh the memory of the readers, this film, starring James Mason, Joan Fontaine, Harry Belafonte, was banned in several southern states in the USA because of interracial romance, which flouted anti-miscegenation laws.
The actress Joan Fontaine even got hate filled letters from members of the white supremacist group KKK.
Anyway, I asked Sir if he bought his long play albums from overseas, to which he said: ‚ÄúSome from the USA and Britain but a lot of them were bought from Shahbagh and Elephant Road, where shops like Gaaner Dali, Geetali sold records.‚Äù

GOING TO THE MOVIES! BETTER DRESS SHARP

A movie buff, Hasnat Abdul Hye, has seen most classics, vividly remembering the thrill of watching James Dean in Giant.
‚ÄúUnfortunate that he died in a car crash in 1955; otherwise, he could have matured to become a Hollywood stalwart,‚Äù observed Sir, adding: ‚ÄúDeath so young has compounded his enigma, which is also a legacy.‚Äù
In the sixties, we went to the movies looking dapper and usually, the film used to be followed by dinner at Chou Ching Chou, the first Chinese restaurant near Gulistan, said the seasoned writer.
When I asked if he had seen the Third Man, his eyes lit up.
‚ÄúOrson Welles was a true superstar and the character of Harry Lime in the film blurs the line between morality and immorality in post-WW2 Germany, where scruples are laid to rest for a swift profit and subterfuge becomes second nature.‚Äù
When I told him that in Satyajit Ray‚Äôs 1966 masterpiece Nayak, Uttam Kumar wearing glasses cut the image of an espionage agent, he nodded with a smile.
The discussion veered to Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift who were friends but more than friends.
Clift was later found to be gay and hence the two never married.

WHAT ARE THE ARABS DOING?

As the evening slipped into night, the discussion moved to the plight of the people of Gaza and Hasnat Abdul Hye said vociferously: ‚ÄúWhy do we always expect Western nations to find peace?
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the responsibility of the Arabian nations to unite and create a robust voice to find a swift and acceptable solution,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúSometimes, I feel, without Arab unity, the sovereignty of several other smaller nations like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan may be in peril,‚Äù he added.
Hasnat Abdul Hye went to West Bengal‚Äôs Ranaghat in 2022 to trace his childhood days when his father was a police inspector at the local police station.
‚ÄúIt was an unforgettable experience as the current officer in charge hosted me and listened to my stories spent in Ranaghat with interest.‚Äù

ENDING WITH A SMILE AND DROP OF TEAR

This Eid, there will be four stories by Hasnat Abdul Hye coming out from different Bangla newspapers.
Recently, he also completed a work, chronicling the tumultuous days of the July-August movement.
As I gave him the European Union in Bangladesh-financed pictorial album, ‚ÄúBangladesh 36 July, 2024‚Äù commemorating the movement immortalised through street art on the walls of Dhaka, he was elated.
The watch showed ten thirty as Frank Sinatra‚Äôs haunting voice filled the room: ‚ÄúIt's a blue world without you; It's a blue world alone; My days and nights that once were filled with heaven; With you away, how empty they have grown.‚Äù
Both of us went quiet, lost in our thoughts, allowing Sinatra to delve into our own little pains.
As Hasnat Abdul Hye was staring at the ceiling with a soft smile, a drop of tear crystallised at the corner of his eye.
Did not ask him anything because there are moments when silence becomes all too eloquent‚Ä¶

" Songkranti in Tangail: Farmers, weavers, and traditions mark the celebration ","
                        
                        
                        Bengali or Bangla New Year is a relatively ‚Äúnew‚Äù celebration, but ‚ÄúSongkranti‚Äù, or in Thailand, ‚ÄúSongkran‚Äù, goes back into the millennia. It comes from the Sanskrit, ‚ÄúSankranta‚Äù and means ‚Äúa move or change‚Äù. It is related to the Zodiac cycle and, of course, any point in the circle is both a beginning and an end. 

In northern India, for instance, April is the beginning of spring when the trees start to bud and bloom and the hibernating animals come out to find food, so, a new beginning. So, for the ancient Indian people, April was a sign of new life and marked the beginning of a new year. That is why they observed, which some still do, their New Year's Day on Apr 13.

And so, on Apr 13, 2009, I visited the UBINIG Ecological Agricultural Centre at Pathrail, Delduar, Tangail where they were observing ‚ÄúSongkranti‚Äù. 

In Bengal, certainly, Songranti has cut across all religions and indeed was there before any religion came to this part of the world. 

Traditionally, the villages still follow certain customs. 

Early in the morning on the Songkranti day, the spiritual leaders drink a very nutritious drink to give them energy through the day on which they might fast. 

The drink is called Chatu and is prepared from millet and sorghum. 

On arrival I drank a glass of this and also a glass of ‚Äúbel‚Äù juice, known to have properties that protect one from sunstroke. 

We were also given two types of puffed reddish rice, combined with ‚Äútok doi‚Äù or yoghurt and liquid ‚Äúgur‚Äù. 

For the previous 3 days a ‚ÄúMela‚Äù or fair had been going on in connection with UBINIG‚Äôs ‚ÄúLocal Variety Rice Preservation Week, 2009,‚Äù where thousands of farmers from various parts of the country, associated with Naya Krishi Andolan, gathered to attend a seminar and participate in the cultural celebrations of Songkranti.

Also, a number of local Tangail weavers had set up stalls to market their beautiful handloom cloth. 



About 500 weaving families survive reasonably well by selling their products through UBINIG‚Äôs sister organisation in Dhaka, ‚ÄúPrabartana‚Äù in Mohammadpur. 

Sadly, however, hundreds of other weavers remain, like bonded labour, in the clutches of the ‚ÄúMahajans‚Äù. 

Near to the handloom weavers‚Äô stalls, we met a village midwife surrounded by more than 50 different medicinal plants in pots which she uses for different problems related to pre-natal, natal, and post natal problems. 

Surely, I say to myself, there is a need to spread this indigenous knowledge further.



She emphasised that for full effect the plants should be growing in their natural habitat and not in pots. 

The pots were just brought to the fair to educate people like us. 

Naya Krishi Andolan has its Community Seed Wealth Centre at UBINIG‚Äôs centre where it preserves and multiplies indigenous rice seed through its farmers. 

They have identified that about 1,200 local varieties are doing well in different parts of the country, but about 500 are endangered varieties. 



We keep hearing that because of ‚Äúclimate change"", new genetically modified hybrid varieties must be developed for drier places, hotter places, more flooded places etc. 

At this centre varieties have already been classified in this way. 

The local varieties, I was told, already, going back centuries, have the characteristics to face up to the problems expected with climate change.

I first visited this area nearly 25 years ago, exploring the villages and studying agriculture and people's livelihoods.

Talking to the local people the other day, especially farmers, was interesting and depressing. 

They say that as, no more, are there ‚Äúbirds of prey‚Äù such as kites hovering up in the sky, it is clear that the ‚Äúfood chain‚Äù has broken and that we are heading for some sort of catastrophe. 

In the old days the fishes and frogs in the paddy fields would eat the insects and the kites would eat them, mice and rats. 

There are no fishes in the paddy fields now and there are far, far less frogs. 

This is all to do, they say, with poisoning the land with fertiliser and insecticide.

We then went to another part of UBINIG where they have a training centre which is also available to others to hire for different purposes. 

We met Tangail farmers with a strong connection to UBINIG who were having a ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù of their own with lots of music and singing.

On our way back to UBINIG‚Äôs main centre for lunch, we were met by a number of Hindu groups of people all dressed up as different mythological entities dancing and singing to send the old year away and welcome the new.



We then went to a ‚ÄúSongkranti‚Äù lunch. 

On this day no meat, fish or eggs should be eaten. 

To emphasise the strong link between man and nature 14 different types of ‚Äúshak‚Äù or spinach are eaten and all 14 varieties have to be ‚Äúuncultivated‚Äù, so had been collected from here and there. 
So we had some red rice, the 14 types of Shak, 5 types of Dal or lentils cooked together as well as a special ‚ÄúKhichuri‚Äù, a turmeric-spiced hodgepodge of rice and lentils.
So this was my ‚ÄúSongkranti‚Äù 2009! A very special day.

" What is Musk's DOGE, the secretive unit operating in the public eye? ","
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump has regularly praised tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency for its role in cutting the size of the federal workforce and halting thousands of government programmes and contracts.

In just nine weeks entire government agencies have been dismantled and tens of thousands of workers from the 2.3-million strong federal workforce have been fired or agreed to take a buyout.

Critics say DOGE has been given extraordinary power by Trump and that it operates with no oversight and in secret, although Musk maintains it is transparent.

Lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions have offered glimpses into its operations but also raised more questions, including whether Musk is actually in charge of DOGE. Government court filings say he is not, but Trump says he is.

WHAT IS DOGE?

DOGE was created by an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office on Jan 20 to ""modernise federal technology and software to maximise governmental efficiency and productivity.""

Despite its name, DOGE is not a government department created by an act of Congress. It is a temporary organisation that took over an existing unit within the White House, the US Digital Service.

Its mandate, due to expire on Jul 4, 2026, now far exceeds the confines of the language of the initial executive order as its staffers sweep through government departments looking for spending and staff cuts.

Musk, the world's richest person, does not draw a government salary and operates as a ""special government employee,"" with a 130-day limit to his role in remaking the federal bureaucracy, the White House has said. Musk told Fox News in March he could stay on for another year.

Facing questions from judges over who exactly is in charge of the unit, the White House named Amy Gleason, a former healthcare executive, as acting administrator.

In a court filing on Mar 19, Gleason said Musk does not work at DOGE. ""I do not report to him, and he does not report to me. To my knowledge, he is a senior advisor to the White House,"" Gleason said.

However, in a speech to Congress on Mar 4, Trump said DOGE ""is headed by Elon Musk."" Musk has also appeared before Trump's cabinet at least twice and at a press briefing in the Oval Office to explain the work of DOGE.

The DOGE team is small, with about 79 appointed employees and 10 employees seconded from other agencies, Gleason said in her court filing.

""Every member of the agency's DOGE team is an employee of the agency or a detailee to the agency,"" Gleason said. She added that DOGE members report to their agency heads, not to her or anyone else at DOGE.

Many of the staffers are young software engineers who are current and former employees in Musk companies. They have little to no experience inside the US government.

Musk has said his goal is to find $1 trillion in savings. The federal budget is set to reach about $7 trillion this year.

HAS DOGE SAVED MONEY?

According to its website, the only official window into its operations, DOGE estimates it has saved US taxpayers $115 billion as of Mar 24 through a series of actions including workforce reductions, asset sales, and contract cancellations.

Yet its savings total is unverifiable and its calculations have been riddled with errors and corrections.

In the ""receipts"" section of its website, DOGE has repeatedly deleted some of its biggest claims to taxpayer savings. For instance, it reported one $8 billion contract that turned out to be worth only $8 million.

As of Mar 24, many of the contracts DOGE claims to have cut have no identification in the receipts section, making it difficult to verify what is being cut.

Musk has said DOGE will correct mistakes when it finds them.

WHAT HAS DOGE DONE?

Musk's team has driven cuts in parts of the federal bureaucracy, hollowing out some agencies and sowing panic among much of the government workforce.

To date, DOGE members have entered more than 20 government agencies, gaining access to computer systems that contain personal data of past and present federal workers and millions more Americans.

Through the Office of Personnel Management, the US government's human resources arm, DOGE sent a buyout offer to government workers in February. About 75,000 accepted the offer, according to the White House.

It has fired or sent termination notices to at least 25,000 other government employees, starting with probationary workers, who have fewer legal protections.

The Trump administration on March 24 asked the US Supreme Court to block an order by a US District judge for government agencies to reinstate thousands of probationary workers.

In February, Trump signed an executive order telling agency heads to work with DOGE to deliver plans by Mar 13 for ‚Äúlarge-scale reductions‚Äù in the federal workforce. White House officials are now reviewing the plans, sources told Reuters.

WHICH AGENCIES HAVE BEEN TARGETED?

The US Agency for International Development, which provides a lifeline to the world's needy, has been shuttered and thousands of its workers sent home.

Another agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which protects Americans from unscrupulous lenders, has also been shut down. Many CFPB employees received termination notices.

The CFPB has investigated claims about loan policies at Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla, raising questions about conflicts of interest. DOGE has also moved into NASA, an agency where some of Musk's companies have billions of dollars in government contracts.

On Mar 17, a DOGE team entered the nonprofit and congressionally funded US Institute of Peace, triggering a lawsuit that claimed the DOGE staffers had entered the building by force after Washington police were called in. The White House accused USIP staffers of defying the president.

Tens of thousands of workers have been targeted for dismissal at federal agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which provides weather forecasting and climate data; the Social Security Administration, which provides benefits to retirees and the disabled; the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service; and the Department of Veterans Affairs, which administers benefits and provides medical care for military veterans.

 Confronting sexual violence: Punishment alone won‚Äôt solve the crisis ,"
                        
                        
                        In the wake of several assaults on women, sexual abuse and a disquieting rise of violations, including the abuse of an 8-year old by members of the family, society in general has erupted in rage and disbelief.

The last incident, where an 8-year old was sexually abused by those who are supposed to be her guardians, leaves us shocked. 

At the same time, we are face to face with a very deviant trait in society, which seems to have spread insidiously.

The perpetrators who violated the child are in custody while the demand of the nation is for a swift resolution of the case and an exemplary punishment. 

The general feeling of swift punishment will act as a deterrent. 

In the last one month, there have been several cases where women became the targets, from being violated inside a bus to being lured into a sex-trap and a savage death, following friendship via social media platforms. 


PERVERSION HAS CREPT IN

Obviously, we feel outraged and indignant because these incidents threaten the safety of women both in rural and urban areas. 

What is more disconcerting is the nature of the crimes and the deviant dimension to them. 

A month ago, a 15-year old girl was brutally raped and killed when she went to meet a 22-year old whom she had befriended via social media. 

The guy in question took her to an empty flat and then, with several others, violated her viciously until the girl lost her life. 

We now have the 8-year old who was attacked by none other than those who are related to her. 

The fact that a young man and his father-in-law were involved in violating the minor underlines a clearly marked line of perversion. 

If we recall, several years ago, a photographer of some repute was arrested by police when it was discovered that he was luring children from low income families and those living on the streets to pose for explicit images, which were later sold overseas to paedophile websites in the dark net. 

For obvious reasons, this provoked an uproar but like all such incidents, they lost the shelf life and we forgot about it. 

There is no news as to the whereabouts of this photographer: is he in prison or was he quietly given release on bail? 

Sexual crime forms a bulk of criminal acts in modern cities and we all need to accept that!

Eradicating this scourge is impossible although with the right measures, the damage can be minimised. 

The current call is for immediate punishment, which is justified, given the savagery of the recent crimes. 

At the same time, there needs to be an in depth assessment as to how such depravity has entered the social structure. 

The answer may lie in centuries of demonising sexual intimacy as shameful and suppressing all sex-related topics.

A natural urge like many other human desires, sexual intimacy has either been treated as taboo or vehemently denounced as ‚ÄúAkaam‚Äù or a ‚Äúmisdeed‚Äù. 

Consequently, due to lack of open discussion within the family and at the academic sphere, wrong notions layered with a sense of guilt has resulted in the development of horribly warped concepts. 

At a certain time, families must bring out the male-female intimacy issue for candid talks, which not only clears plenty of misconceptions but also makes a person aware of what has to be done to protect oneself. 

Let‚Äôs take the girl who went to meet the boy she had befriended on social media as an example. 

If she had shared the information about meeting a male friend, either with senior family members or with her teacher or friend, then, for her own safety, the family or the teacher or friend would have ensured she kept the location on her phone open to track her movements.  

Deviant sexual fantasies stem from a social creed where even husband-wife intimacy is often frowned upon because from childhood, the physical urge was labelled ‚Äúunholy‚Äù. 

A large part of society still has pronounced hesitation to openly state that the purpose of intimacy is not just for procreation but also for pleasure! 




PREDATORS IN THE FAMILY 

Punishment of the perpetrators of recent physical abuse will take place since there is so much pressure from all sides. 

But let‚Äôs not be content with only the punishment of one group of criminals. 

This will hardly address the issue of deviant sexual proclivities. 

The question of the moment: where should a girl feel safe if not within her familiar circle? 

That brings us to another despicable culture ‚Äì the inappropriate touching of minors! 

Unfortunately, much of this abominable act is carried out within family spheres where the victim is often forced to remain silent in case she is blamed. 

Not surprisingly, these acts are camouflaged under a social creed, which allows or expects us to be tactile.  

What is perceived as an affectionate touch may not appear that caring to the person whose body is being touched. 

The slight, almost imperceptible distinction between a harmless loving touch and the vile caress of a predator, is often not noticed or, simply dismissed. 

While several schools have begun classes focusing on biological changes during adolescence, a more open approach is needed with a nationwide multi-media drive with ten simple rules to stay safe and spot the abuser. 

Several newspaper editorials have repeatedly called for the introduction of women police officers to run special cells at all city stations with support from psychologists and youth counsellors who will go to every school and college in a specific ward, holding open discussions and individual counselling sessions. 

One of the reforms of the police force has to include a special cell for women, run by women and supported by specialists. 

If necessary, the government can seek international support from development partners, either in the form of funds or through training and capacity building. Large business conglomerates should come forward to associate with these campaigns as part of CSR.  

Such a cell may begin in rural areas too with support and active participation from the local educated youth. 



CAN LICENSED BROTHELS CURB SEXUAL CRIME?

We now wade into contentious territory. 

Prostitution is supposed to be legal and regulated in Bangladesh although red light areas such as Taan Bazaar in Narayanganj and English Road in Old Dhaka were demolished on morality grounds more than two decades ago. 

The rather elaborate rationale used at that time for the eviction of sex workers from the centuries-old red light areas was that their presence was eroding moral values, leading to decadence. 

Many will contend, with reason, that sex work is a vice, whereas others will maintain that this is a necessary evil, essential to keep a check on sexual abuse and rape. 

Without doubt, this argument as to whether brothels should be given the green light or not will provoke strong reactions from puritans and those who abide by social norms.

Although, instead of looking at this from a very black and white angle, the complex imponderables have to be taken into account. 

A state-overseen licensed red light zone will provide security to sex workers, health care service, education to their children and, over time, a way out for those who seek to be rehabilitated into the general life. 

On the contrary, the smoke and dagger dominated sex industry where everything is clandestine is a bane for sex workers who become victims of exploitative practices, leading to a life of degradation marked by drug abuse, depravity, and sometimes, suicide. 

A properly run brothel where workers are regularly screened with focus on hygiene, security, and protection may be a practical need of the time. 

Instead of using vacuous exhortations like society must learn to adhere to strict moral code, reality along with its not-too-savoury intricacies have to be grasped. 

In conclusion, let‚Äôs deviate a bit: in Dhaka, there are often midnight raids at low-cost hotels, which lead to the busting of sex work, catering to the working class people. 

Many TV stations also run stories with salacious details of women offering services at budget hotels. 

On the other hand, countless high-end escorts who offer services at swanky establishments to wealthy clients are immune to such legal raids.

Instead, these five-star entities are guarded by men and women in uniform and those who revel in them do so with impunity. 

A line from Oscar Wilde captures this double standard: The real tragedy of the poor is that they cannot afford anything but self-denial. Beautiful things, like beautiful sins, are the privilege of the rich!

 Ditching the suit: the message behind a leader's casual look ,"
                        
                        
                        In the late 70s, when we were at school, there was a story in our Bangla textbook about Sheikh Saadi, a 13th century Persian poet and thinker. 

The message of the story was profound, leaving a mark on many. 

In short, here is how it goes: a man of repute is invited to a party and decides to appear in simple clothes. 

But his appearance is met with derision and he is refused entry and driven away unceremoniously. 

The same person goes back home, changes into majestic attire and then comes back to a regal reception. 

At the dinner table, the host is surprised to see that instead of eating, the man is putting food on his gem-encrusted robe. 

When asked, the guest replies: since the behaviour of everyone changes due to my clothes, it‚Äôs fitting to feed it! 

There is a very powerful message here: treat a human for what she or he is and not by his material possessions or attractive clothes. 

Now, from the angle of philosophy, this makes sense but we all know, in society, if not expensive, proper attire is always an asset. 


ZELENSKY DOES NOT WEAR A SUIT 

This brings us to the recent White House spat between the presidents of Ukraine and the United States. 

What started out as a very polite interaction suddenly waded into rough terrain, triggered by a question regarding President Zelensky‚Äôs tendency to avoid wearing a suit whenever he is on state visits. 

At the meeting between the presidents, a reporter present asked, in what may be called a very offending voice, if he owned a suit or not.

The same person then added in an admonishing tone as to why Zelensky refuses to wear a suit. 

Let us try to put that White House in the context of everyday life. 

Would you ask such a pointed question to a person you invited to your place in front of others, even if the clothes she or he wore did not please you? 

Well, such acts are not unheard of and are done simply to denigrate others. 

This question about not wearing formal clothes was asked to Zelensky about a year ago when he was in an interview wearing a T-shirt and he replied that once the predicament of his country was over, he would dress properly. 

Sounds like a very sensible statement to me! 

Well, if he had worn a suit and a tie it would not have lessened his position, however, the current choice of his clothes underline the struggle his nation is going through. 

In fact, looking dapper with death and destruction plaguing his country would have appeared callous!

In any setting involving international dignitaries, his preference for smart casual with black as the colour, carries the message of Ukrainian stoicism in the face of aggression. 

But let‚Äôs go back into history a bit to find those who decided to make sartorial statements by breaking convention. 

At the UN in 1960, Fidel Castro gave what is believed to be the longest speech, wearing the trademark olive green uniform of the revolutionary Cuban army. 

Che Guevara was hardly ever seen in anything else but the olive green combination. 

In the 70s, many political leaders from humid countries decided to shun the traditional suit and don the more casual safari suit. 

In Zaire, now DRC, the Abacost was made the national dress in the 70s - a word shortened for a bas le costume meaning ‚Äúdown with the suit‚Äù. 

This was part of a wider authenticity programme aimed at reducing influence of attire with colonial ties. 

The then head of state Mobutu wore this during his state visits. 

In Indonesia and Malaysia, the formal dress is not a suit but the traditional silk shirt with elaborate designs over formal trousers. 

In Bangladesh, both former president Ziaur Rahman and HM Ershad were Safari suit enthusiasts. 

Their love for the two piece comfortable dress percolated to all levels of government and civil administration, thus making it the official attire from the top boss to the office service staff. 

Post revolution Bangladesh has a Nobel laureate as the head of state who has defined a new style by donning clothes made by local artisans. 

Muhammad Yunus is meeting foreign dignitaries in his attire of comfort. 

I do not think if the occasion rises, he will change his preference to please any head of country. 


DICTATING CLOTHES IN THE LAND OF THE FREE?

There‚Äôs no denying that a formal suit and tie exude elegance and dignity. 

However, it‚Äôs also a fact that when everyone tries to fit into a template, originality suffers. 

The USA is believed to be a nation where libertarian values are not only cherished but encouraged. 

Or, has there been a radical shift recently? 

All throughout the 80s, when the staple TV entertainment in Bangladesh featured American TV shows like A Team, MacGyver, Knight Rider, Fall Guy and the lot, the liberal creed of the country in all affairs from religion to education to clothes captivates young Bangladeshis. 

In a way, it‚Äôs the love for US TV shows, featuring liberal values, which triggered the ‚ÄúUSA for higher education‚Äùcraze in the 80s. 

These Bangladeshis later formed the foundation of the large US-Bangla diaspora. 

Coming back to the White House drama, the word formal attire has evolved so much that what Zelensky was wearing could very well pass as formal because it was all black without any exposure of arms or chest. 

I am not sure if there‚Äôs a dress code stating ‚Äúsuits are a must‚Äù to see the US president at the White House. 

Would the Saudi crown prince be derided if he did not wear one? 

I am sure, if he ever goes to meet Trump he will be in his national dress and certainly not a suit. 

And it‚Äôs also certain no impudent reporter will have the guts to inquire if he owned one or not. 

Actually, this question related to the suit, if asked in a humorous tone, could have eased the situation more and added a little bit of conviviality. 

Zelensky maintains he will wear one when the war ends and, if Trump had said, it would be a pleasure to buy him one, the atmosphere could have become so much friendlier. 

Unfortunately, these questions were posed deliberately to trivialise another head of state whose country is fighting an aggression. 

One wonders, how common Americans are interpreting this sort of bullying behaviour at the White House? 

Anyway, Zelensky is in Britain now where the feeling is much cosier. 

With cheers outside Number 10, it was evident, Britain has no problems with his clothes. 

In International politics, small issues snowball into big ones influencing global image. 

Well, it seems for the time being it‚Äôs a triumph for the Union Jack. 

By the way, Zelensky is also meeting King Charles! 

Perhaps the king will add another soothing layer adding: ‚ÄúI say, Mr president, when this ghastly business is over, I will send you my tailors (Gieves & Hawkes)!‚Äù

 In Gotham city without Batman! Dhaka's fight against crime heats up ,"
                        
                        
                        The recent spate of lawlessness in Dhaka is certainly alarming and has triggered a sense of consternation among people, although I must say that in my area, Elephant Road, Nilkhet and New Market, there has not been any major incidents of burglary, robbery or hijacking. 

Yet, the apprehension among people of several areas is palpable and justified because, recently, a video posted on Facebook showed a very disturbing scene of bike riding thugs snatching a bag and firing at the victim. 

Several videos emerged in the past few week, compounding the sense of fear.  



Onlookers from tall buildings recording the incident on the phone could do little because naturally, facing off with crooks carrying firearms would have been foolhardy. 

This is not to say Dhaka has turned into a crime zone but in certain areas, criminal activity is being noticed which can be tackled with a few strategic moves, especially with Ramadan knocking at the door. 

To refer to the heading, even if Batman is not present, Gotham has to survive and fight crime. 

WARD BASED VIGILANTE GROUPS 
Masks and capes are not necessary although a few robust batons or truncheons can work to contain street crime. 

However, the ward commissioner‚Äôs office has a role to launch area based youth vigilante groups which should operate after dark. 

In the period following Aug 5, many members of the law-enforcing agency did not join, leaving the police short staffed. 

While this is being addressed, the ward commissioner, with support from eminent residents of an area, can raise funds to support a temporary security force comprising enthusiastic people who are permanent residents of a particular area. 

Raising a fund from every household, based on financial capacity, this force, with each group comprising three to four members, can be supplied with batons, torches and whistles. 

Where possible, the groups may also include one or two armed Ansar members, carrying walkie-talkies to maintain contact with the local police station. 

CC CAMERAS TO BE MADE MANDATORY 


The advantage of closed-circuit or CC cameras is that it allows the police to follow movements of criminals. 

If one camera records the perpetrators at the crime spot then even if the goons are masked and leave the scene swiftly, the task of tracing them using cameras of other areas becomes easier. 

The usage of drones to keep surveillance has not caught on in Dhaka as yet although during the July-August uprisings, drone cameras were hovering all over the Dhaka University campus and adjacent areas. 

The police of areas which have seen a sudden surge of criminal acts can begin drone surveillance units by providing part time drone operating duty to young people during Ramadan as many traders, shop attendants and shoppers, will come back home late.  

As Ramadan begins with the spirit of restraint marking the first fifteen days, in the last two weeks, the whole city will slip into a spending spree ‚Äì a time, which will also be a temptation for criminals.  

MODERNISING POLICE OPERATIONS 


In wealthy countries, top cities have police choppers doing rounds, although in Bangladesh, this still may prove too expensive. 

However, a very practical solution to allow police into narrow lanes and by lanes would be through the usage of motorised rickshaws. 

It may not be too impractical for specific police stations to buy motorised rickshaws. 

In similar manner, boats fitted with engines can provide security on the river since many traders will be coming to Dhaka during Ramadan. 


GUN PERMITS FOR PEOPLE WITH GENUINE NEEDS     


We now wade into a very complex territory. 

In Bangladesh, as far as I know, small arms permits are given as a tool strictly for self defence and the granting of the license comes with several very rules, one of which is, the weapon can never be carried openly and has to be declared at major public gathering spots, like airports, hotels etc. 

To get a small arms permit, the application procedure is no short of Kafkaesque. 

For a common person who feels his or her life may be under threat, either due to their profession or social status, it‚Äôs often next to impossible to get the permit. 

Strangely, people with political connections have always found a way to get hold of permits, making the gun permit approval highly politicised and discriminatory. 

For instance, a journalist, doctor, or even an actor‚Äîwho is often compelled to work and travel late at night‚Äîwill face an uphill task in getting a permit. 

In contrast, during the last regime, countless politically linked people manipulated connections to get licenses.

Permits were granted to people with dubious and questionable backgrounds simply because they had political blessings. 

A very fitting analogy goes like this: if someone from a low-income background goes to a budget  hotel with a sex worker, he may be arrested and rebuked for being involved in ‚Äúanti-social‚Äù behaviour. 

However, if one drives into a plush hotel in an SUV with an escort, the guards cordially open the door and society accepts it, often with admiration, as a casual distraction of the wealthy.  

For the ordinary man who may feel insecure travelling at night, the process is not only complex but almost impossible. 

Also, there is the puzzling rule saying that to apply for a permit, the applicant has to show a high income tax payment for three years in a row. 

Guns are never a solution but the process should be reformed in a way to ensure genuine people can hope to get a permit. 

Reportedly, for a small arms permit, one step involves a direct quizzing by the district administrator. 

This is fine but this stage needs to include one member of the civil society or media and a mid-senior ranking officer from the defence forces.   

In the wake of recent criminal activities, the defence forces are seen on the roads, which is laudable. 

Senior members of the national cadet corps and scouts can also be employed to maintain a blanket security coverage of Dhaka during Ramadan. 

To end on a lighter note, if the government decides to introduce a new crime-fighting unit, equipped with state of the art machinery, it may be fitting to call it Bat-men! What say you?

 Fintech collaboration: Catalysing Bangladesh‚Äôs digital finance renaissance ,"
                        
                        
                        The global financial ecosystem is undergoing a rapid transformation, driven by fintech collaborations, open banking frameworks, and AI-powered innovations. As economies transition from traditional banking models to tech-driven financial systems, Bangladesh stands at a critical crossroads. Despite positive macroeconomic indicators, the finance sector remains heavily reliant on cash transactions and legacy banking infrastructure.


While mobile financial services (MFS) and fintech players have made significant strides in improving financial inclusion, their impact remains limited due to a lack of structured collaboration between banks, fintech startups, and regulators.


According to the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM, 2024), over 70 percent of banking institutions in Bangladesh still operate on outdated IT systems. This inefficiency results in high operational costs, slow transaction processing, and limited access to credit for individuals and SMEs.


The urgency for digital transformation is undeniable, and the question is no longer whether Bangladesh should embrace fintech collaboration, but how quickly it can implement an integrated open finance framework.


By adopting open banking, regulatory-driven digital lending, AI-powered credit scoring, and interoperable payment systems, Bangladesh can usher in a new era of financial accessibility, efficiency, and security.


THE POWER OF FINTECH-BANKING COLLABORATION


India‚Äôs Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has revolutionised the nation‚Äôs payment ecosystem. According to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI, 2024), UPI facilitated over 10 billion transactions per month in 2023, becoming one of the most successful real-time digital payment systems globally.


Several key factors are key to UPI‚Äôs success:

 

Regulatory support: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandated banks to integrate UPI, ensuring seamless adoption.
	Open API infrastructure: Standardised APIs allowed fintech companies to build services on top of existing banking infrastructure with ease.
	Cost reduction: UPI transactions cost approximately 95% less compared to traditional card-based payments, making digital payments more accessible for all.

The UAE has also leveraged open finance regulations to boost digital banking adoption and expand financial inclusion. The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE, 2024) introduced an Open Finance framework, facilitating collaboration between banks, fintech companies, and regulators.


The key benefits of this system are:

 

Faster SME loan processing: AI-powered credit scoring models analyse alternative data, reducing SME loan processing times by 60% (CBUAE, 2024).
	Increased digital banking adoption: Cloud-based integration of fintech services led to a rise in digital banking, especially among young consumers and SMEs (CBUAE, 2024).
	Enhanced cybersecurity: Stringent cybersecurity measures, such as multi-factor authentication and AI-powered fraud detection, have improved trust in digital financial services.

These two examples can serve as guidelines for Bangladesh. We should develop regulatory sandboxes for fintech innovations, introduce fintech licensing frameworks, and standardise digital KYC processes to enhance financial inclusion.


THE NEED FOR A DIGITAL OVERHAUL IN BANKING


Bangladesh‚Äôs banking sector remains dependent on traditional, manual processes, which hinder efficiency and innovation. According to a study by Bangladesh Bank (2023), many institutions still use manual underwriting, batch processing, and fragmented payment infrastructures. This results in slow service delivery and limited financial inclusion.


The key challenges for the system are:

 

High operational costs: Legacy core banking systems are costly to maintain and lack real-time processing capabilities.
	Slow credit approvals: Manual underwriting leads to delays in loan approvals, particularly affecting SMEs.
	Limited financial inclusion: Collateral-based lending excludes many potential borrowers, including micro-entrepreneurs and gig workers.

Fintech integration can solve these challenges through:

 

API-driven banking: Open APIs enable seamless integration between banks, fintech platforms, and MFS, leading to faster loan approvals and improved financial services.
	AI-powered risk assessment: Alternative data, such as mobile transactions and social media activity, can help assess creditworthiness more accurately.
	Cloud-based core banking systems: Cloud-native platforms lower IT costs, enable faster innovation, and ensure scalability.

QR: A GAME-CHANGER FOR DIGITAL PAYMENTS


Bangladesh Bank‚Äôs Bangla QR initiative aims to drive financial inclusion and reduce cash dependency by offering a standardised QR payment system that improves interoperability across banks, MFS, and fintech apps.


This system allows:

 

Enhancing interoperability: The QR payment system enables customers to make transactions across various platforms, increasing the adoption of digital payments.
	Reducing cash dependency: It is projected that Bangla QR will reduce cash usage by 50% within five years, contributing to a transition to a cashless economy.
	Increasing government revenues: Formalising digital transactions improves transparency and reduces tax evasion.

In order to make this initiative successful, it is necessary to mandate QR adoption across all sectors, introduce merchant incentives to boost adoption, and integrate QR payments with digital lending platforms.


IS AI-POWERED CREDIT SCORING THE FUTURE OF LENDING?


AI-based credit scoring models are transforming the lending landscape globally by reducing default rates and speeding up loan processing. In Bangladesh, traditional credit scoring methods often exclude many people from accessing financial services.


The problems with Bangladesh‚Äôs current credit assessment model are:

 

Manual credit risk evaluation: Slows down loan processing.
	Lack of credit history: Many individuals and SMEs lack formal credit records, making them ineligible for loans.
	Siloed data: Fragmented data limits fintech and alternative lending services.

How could this be improved?

 

AI-powered credit assessments: Credit scores can be dynamically updated based on customer behaviour, enabling personalised financial products and proactive recovery solutions.
	CIB API: A real-time credit information bureau API managed by Bangladesh Bank could expand access to credit by incorporating alternative data sources like utility bill payments, mobile wallet transactions, and e-commerce earnings.

STRENGTHENING CYBERSECURITY TO PROTECT BANGLADESH‚ÄôS DIGITAL FUTURE


As fintech collaboration increases, so do cybersecurity concerns. To build trust and ensure the long-term success of digital financial services, robust security measures must be implemented.


The key cybersecurity threats are:

 

Phishing and social engineering attacks
	Weak data protection policies
	Lack of real-time fraud detection systems

In order to combat this, Bangladesh needs to implement:

 

Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and end-to-end encryption.
	Use AI-powered fraud detection to prevent real-time threats.
	Adopt GDPR-like data privacy standards.

A STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE FOR BANGLADESH‚ÄôS FINANCIAL ECOSYSTEM


Fintech collaboration will significantly impact Bangladesh‚Äôs customer lifecycle, recovery processes, and long-term engagement strategies. With AI-driven tools, cloud-based systems, and interoperable payment platforms, banks can offer more personalised services, boosting customer retention and satisfaction.


To unlock its full potential, Bangladesh must integrate real-time payment solutions to enable personalised financial products, improve recovery strategies with AI-powered models for overdue payment management, foster long-term relationships by personalising services based on customer data and enhancing cybersecurity.


These steps will pave the way for a more inclusive, secure, and efficient digital finance ecosystem in Bangladesh.

" Bangla's changing face: slang, tradition, and the need for balance ","
                        
                        
                        On Feb 21, a TV channel aired a drama where the protagonist takes a very vocal stand against what is deemed the distortion of the Bangla language.  

He is seen working at a media house where most people speak Bangla with words either taken from English or, express their feelings through portmanteau words.  

The main character vehemently opposes what he deems vulgarisation of the language and is seen fervently relating to an expat lady superior as to how Bangla was allowed a state language in the face of a mass uprising in 1952 with the sacrifice of precious lives. 

Perhaps in our passion to exhibit love for our mother tongue, we often fail to check historical facts. 

The then West Pakistan government officially recognised Bangla as a state language not in 1952 but in 1956. 

Anyway, this is a minor oversight and the fact remains that whether we sometimes add other words to our language, simply innovate new meanings to old ones, or, come up with something totally unheard of, we love our language. 

Come on, that‚Äôs what we heard when we were born and when abroad, realise the depth of that love when Bangla is heard amidst a crowd.   

Mind you, the person who is using words taken from some other language is actually speaking Bangla, but Bangla which is colloquial. 

In a written format, that person will either use proper Bangla or, if in trouble, take the help of a writer or the dictionary. 

I do not see that as a major crime. Yes, we must all learn to speak the language properly because it has so many beautiful (read fascinating) words. And I concur, eloquence always turns heads, gets the right attention and, naturally, admiration from everyone, especially the opposite sex. 

However, when one is among friends and is letting the guard down, s/he is permitted a little latitude, right? 

If acclaimed writer Hasnat Abdul Hye, whose Bangla prose is refined to the point of being sublime, can use Lage Ura Dhura as a book title, we can all relax and enjoy the spice of the language. 

Let‚Äôs look at it this way, everyone loves the art film with a profound message but there are times too for the provocative item number filled candyfloss masala movie without any meaning. Otherwise, Toofan would not have become such a runaway hit, attracting millions of expat Bangladeshis to shows arranged overseas.  

THE ‚ÄòPANKHA‚Äô TIME WITH BUDDIES  

You are on the roof with pals, the music is playing, the late winter breeze is blowing and someone just placed three plates of puri and singara on Foodpanda. Now you can either use ‚Äúpankha‚Äù or, the language expert may decide to say: ‚Äúbesh uddipona pachchhi!‚Äù Hey, both are alright but maybe, you will use the former. What if you hear someone called Jack Daniels is on the way!! Well, you are both ‚Äúshihorito‚Äù or, if I am permitted to say ‚Äúpurai pankha‚Äù. 

Now at that moment, a phone call from the boss for an urgent work, which (according to his honey soaked voice) will ‚Äúonly take an hour‚Äù will be a complete ‚Äúpera‚Äù or, ‚Äúoshanti‚Äù. 

You were stuck in the office for a little longer than usual and came to the gym when it was about to close. Of course, the guard or ‚Äúmama‚Äù can keep it open for a half an hour; however, in a stony face he relates the time regulation rules to you. 

Mama, stop giving me ‚Äúfapor‚Äù and here is Tk 50, go have some tea and puri and I will be done in a jiffy!  

You could have said: ‚Äúmama jotilota na kore, amake ektu shomoy den!‚Äù 

Correct and proper indeed but does not it sound a little silly!  

I mean mama would think you are on something!

THE ‚ÄòOSTHEER‚Äô MOMENT OF LIFE 

Ostheer is very much part of our spoken lingo now. Literally, this means restive or volatile. If you are a newspaper reader, the word ‚Äúrajnoitik ostheerota‚Äù or political volatility should not be a new term. But using this to refer to something sensational is a recent phenomenon. As far as I can recall, the term started to be used widely sometime around 2013-2014 to allude to an ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù experience or something mind-blowing. 

Well, from that date on a boat on a cloudy surreal afternoon to being present at the jam-packed concert featuring James to feasting on a whole roasted goat by the forest ‚Äì the list of ‚Äúostheer‚Äù experiences is endless. Now you may certainly use, ‚Äúdudrdanto‚Äù, ‚Äúobisshoronio‚Äù or, you how about: ‚Äúsheirokom, sheirokom‚Äù! 

However, the usage of ‚Äúostheer‚Äù is better kept within friends because someone I know found himself in a pickle when he used ‚Äúostheer, ostheer‚Äù to describe his bride to be, also a BCS cadre officer, to his parents.


LEARN PROPER BANGLA BY ALL MEANS 


Having defended the innovative words, one has to say, a little assertively, that while we may enjoy using words which have come to mean something different from their original meaning or, are recent creations, there is no alternative to learning and using correct Bangla. This does not mean one has to begin using ‚Äúshitatop niontron jontro‚Äù or ‚Äúkedara‚Äù instead of AC or sofa. Nor are you required to say ‚Äúmutho phone‚Äù instead of mobile, but let us also know and use a list of standard Bangla words which we can use on formal occasions. 

For example, if you are invited to a formal dinner and feel the need to praise your host, then perhaps it would be wise to use ‚Äúbhai, darun ayojon‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmamma, fataye halaisen‚Äù. 

At any interview, language proficiency is a key requirement with the interview panel, assessing a candidate on his/her diction, usage of words and speaking style. 

This applies to fresh graduates seeking to enter the job market, but more importantly, to senior professionals aspiring to move higher. In fact, for those who are interviewing for a post with more than 20 years-experience, the crucial factor is always the ability to communicate and the capability to use language persuasively. 

Whether it‚Äôs Bangla or English, the interview panel will have decided, subconsciously, if they found you appealing or not, in the first four minutes. Trust me, 80 percent of that positive impression is made with the language!

So, no harm using the casual terms in a friendly environment but to shine at formal occasions, let‚Äôs learn proper Bangla. 

After the interview, when buddies ask: ‚Äúdost kemon hoise?‚Äù You can always say, ‚Äúbarood, dost, barood!‚Äù

 Syria‚Äôs future: will democracy follow Assad‚Äôs fall? ,"
                        
                        
                        Following the fall of the Assad government, the ambiguous stance of the new ruling Hayat Tahrir al-Sham government on democratic transition has raised serious doubts about Syria's future trajectory toward democracy.


It has been over two months since the brutal secular dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted by the Sunni Islamist paramilitary organisation Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. This group consists of several armed Islamist factions and is led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, the founder of Jabhat al-Nusra, which is the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda. 

Ironically, al-Sharaa‚Äôs father, Hussein Ali al-Sharaa, a University of Baghdad economics graduate, was a Nasserist Arab nationalist who published numerous books on regional economic development.

The recent takeover of power in Damascus by the extremist group HTS marks a significant shift in the dynamics of the region. This development is particularly noteworthy because HTS has not only gained control over key areas but has also successfully outmanoeuvred both Western-backed relatively moderate factions and other rebel groups supported by Turkey.

From Peaceful Democratic Protests to Armed Islamist Insurgency 

In January 2011, what began as minor demonstrations in various cities transformed into massive nationwide protests by March, demanding the end of the Assad regime. Initially, these protests were peaceful; however, after a brutal crackdown by the regime, they escalated into violent resistance led by various rebel factions, most of which were influenced by Islamist ideology in their struggle. 

The Arab and Western media, along with their respective governments, supported efforts to overthrow Asad, often labelling most of the opposition as moderate. This designation frequently obscured their true political affiliations and agendas. Such selective portrayal contributed to a complex and sometimes misleading understanding of the dynamics of the Syrian conflict. However, the situation has shifted dramatically since the HTS seized control of Damascus and a significant portion of its territory.

This shift raises an important question: Is it possible for the long-sought dream of democracy, for which the Syrian people have made immense sacrifices, to be realised under the leadership of HTS? 

 Sharaa announced in an interview with Saudi state broadcaster Al Arabiya that drafting a new constitution suitable for the current situation will likely take three years. An additional year will be needed to hold a new election. This provides a rough timeline for when the election might take place. 

At this stage, it is still too early to provide a trajectory of the post-dictatorial regime. The situation is complicated by the absence of viable political parties that can effectively represent diverse interests, as well as a lack of a strong civil society that could contribute meaningfully to the democratic process. Additionally, it remains unclear on what basis participants will be allowed to engage in elections, which raises significant concerns about inclusivity and representation in the political landscape.

Democratic or Islamist Pathway

At present, there are two nations that are primarily governed by Islamists. In Afghanistan, the political landscape is characterised by an utter absence of popular representation, with the state firmly controlled by the Taliban. This control effectively stifles any semblance of democratic governance, leaving the citizens without a voice in their political future. In contrast, Iran's electoral process is severely restricted, as only those who are loyal to the regime are permitted to run for office, ensuring that dissenting views are systematically excluded from the political arena.

It is still too early to determine whether, under the current circumstances, HTS will choose to replicate the authoritarian structures seen in Afghanistan and Iran, or if they will respect the will of the people by pursuing a path of governance that aligns with the liberal democratic principles recognised in Western societies.

In the meantime, the new Syrian authority is gradually, though slowly, shifting towards the Islamisation of the country. This is evident in changes to the school curriculum, where critics argue that there is now an Islamist bias in the teaching materials. Additionally, Islamic teachings have been incorporated into police training programmes. 

            Furthermore, regarding women's rights, the HTS implements strict regulations in Idlib that severely restrict their dress, mobility, and public roles. Women who fail to comply with these regulations face fines, public shaming, or even detention by the HTS morality police. 

Despite their claims of supporting women's rights and education, their ideological stance towards women and minorities is becoming increasingly evident. While they aim to push women back into traditional roles, they also seek to gradually suppress the equal rights of religious minorities, including the former ruling Alawites. This is becoming more apparent in both the proposed discussions for a new constitution and their day-to-day treatment of women and minorities.

The Western Dilemma

The dilemma for the West lies in its selective application of a value-based foreign policy. While it typically seeks good relations with countries that prioritise human rights, democracy, and freedom of speech, there is a longstanding pattern of forming alliances with nations that have poor records on these issues. 

In Syria, the West supports opposition rebel factions with the aim of establishing democracy and protecting the rights of minorities and women. However, the ambiguous position of the ruling group, HTS, on these issues has placed the West in a challenging situation regarding its foreign policy.

The situation at the Russian air base in Khmeimim and the naval base in Tartus has further complicated the West's efforts to achieve its foreign policy objectives. In this context, the West has indicated that addressing these issues is closely tied to the possibility of receiving assistance.

Many in the West were surprised to find that the anti-Russian group HTS did not expel Russian personnel, nor did Russia refuse to cooperate with the HTS government. Contrary to expectations, both former adversaries agreed to collaborate, and there are currently no signs that Russian bases in Syria will be removed.

 In contrast to Western foreign policy, which often prioritises values, Russian foreign policy is primarily driven by realpolitik, focusing on interest-based considerations. This approach allows Russia to build relationships with any regime, regardless of its ideological beliefs, human rights record, or level of democracy.

In modern history, there are no documented cases of armed groups in Asia, Africa, and Latin America successfully establishing democracy by organising free, fair, and inclusive elections after seizing state power. If the armed Islamist group HTS takes the initiative to create a Western-style liberal democracy in Syria, it will mark a significant new chapter in modern history. However, up to this point, they have not shown any indications of moving in that direction.

 The unique particulars of the Japanese language ,"
                        
                        
                        In 1999, UNESCO declared Feb 21 as International Mother Language Day. Soon after, I came across a slogan in a country's leaflet, which when translated into English means ‚Äì ‚ÄúEach letter is a star in the galaxy of language‚Äù.

The line stuck with me and eventually led to me writing the first line of a Bengali song composed by renowned music director Maqsud Jamil Mintoo and sung by popular vocalist Atiq Hasan: ‚ÄúStars are like the alphabet in the sky.‚Äù

Just as a night sky full of stars is a treasure trove of beauty, each language made up of letters is a treasure trove of immense riches. According to information from Ethnologue, a research organisation on language intelligence, there are currently 7,164 languages in use in the world. The organization has been publishing the list of the world's largest languages for more than 15 years.

According to the list of the top 20 most spoken languages in 2024, English ranks first, Bengali ranks seventh, and Japanese ranks thirteenth. English is used by 1.5 billion people, 278.2 million people use Bengali, and 123.5 million people use Japanese.

About 99 percent of Japanese speakers live in Japan. Most Japanese speakers outside Japan live in the United States (Hawaii and California) and Brazil (S√£o Paulo and Paran√°). That connection with Brazil might be why Alessandro Santos - a famous footballer who was born in Brazil (Paran√°) - played for the Japanese national team in the 2002 World Cup.

Foreign words have also become a permanent fixture in other languages, including Bengali. In addition to the words tadbhava, deshi, tatshama, and ardha-tatshama, Bengali has a lot of foreign or loanwords. The first Japanese word I learned in my life was ‚Äòrickshaw‚Äô. While studying grammar in my childhood, I learned that the word rickshaw (‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶∂‡¶æ) is derived from Japanese. When I went to Japan for higher studies, I had a dream to see a Japanese rickshaw. During a visit to Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan, that dream came true. I rushed towards the Japanese version of the vehicle with great interest, but I stopped after contented myself with only taking a photo. I didn't dare to get on - it was far too expensive, especially when compared to the norm in Bangladesh.

Japanese rickshaws are still running in Kyoto, are quite an attraction for tourists, and are even utilised for weddings. In Japanese, they are called `jin-rikisha‚Äô; jin means human, i.e., a human-powered vehicle. The rickshaw-pullers pull them on foot, much like the pulled rickshaws of Kolkata.

Courtesy of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, or JICA, the medium of instruction in my JDS Master‚Äôs program was English, but there was also a mandatory Japanese language course ‚Äì two months in Bangladesh, and two months in Japan. It was taught by Japanese teachers. They never talked to us in English, nor in Bengali, but in Japanese. It was a serious course. There were both written and oral exams. In the end, we received a certificate. During my studies, I noticed some unique, if not strange, features of the Japanese language.

THREE TYPES OF SCRIPTS FOR THE SAME SOUND

The Bengali alphabet has 2 letters (‡¶®/‡¶£) for pronouncing the sound ‡¶® (na) or 3 letters (‡¶∂/‡¶∑/‡¶∏) for pronouncing the sound ‡¶∂ (sh). This is not the case with the Japanese language. Bengali uses a single script derived from the ancient Brahmi script family. But the Japanese language has three sets of alphabets. In other words, the Japanese use three different writing systems: kanji, hiragana and katakana.

Kanji are called characters. They were initially used to write Chinese characters but were gradually developed systematically to represent Japanese sounds and words. The Japanese also created new characters to represent words that did not resemble Chinese kanji. These new kanji are called ‚Äòmanyogana‚Äô (‰∏áËëâ‰ªÆÂêç) and are considered the precursors of the Japanese scripts, hiragana and katakana.

Hiragana is derived from the cursive style of kanji, and katakana is derived from the segment of kanji. Hiragana and katakana are letter-based, with each letter representing a single sound. They have five vowels: a, i, u, a, o.

The bottom-line message is that there are 3 types of characters or scripts for the same sound in Japanese. For example, the sound 'ki' has characters or scripts in all three - hiragana, katakana and kanji.

To illustrate the point, let us take a look at different examples. The Japanese word for rain is 'ame', the Japanese word for flower is 'hana', and the Japanese word for river is 'kawa'. Now there are separate characters in hiragana, katakana and kanji to write 'ame', 'hana' and 'kawa'. In that case, do the Japanese write the same word in hiragana, katakana, or kanji whenever they want? No. There are rules. For example, hiragana is used for local or pure Japanese words and grammatical elements, such as: 'ame', 'hana' and 'kawa'. But only foreign words are written in katakana - writing foreign words in hiragana is incorrect. For example: The Japanese words for the English words, television, camera, personal computer, and hotel are terebi, kamera, pasokon, and hoteru, respectively. The Japanese words for the German ‚Äòpart-time job‚Äô are ‚Äòarubaito‚Äô, the Japanese words for the Dutch word ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô are ‚Äòkohi‚Äô, the Japanese words for the Turkish word ‚Äòyogurt‚Äô are ‚Äòyogurto‚Äô, etc. When writing these foreign words, using the katakana alphabet is mandatory.

So, for the sake of ease of understanding, the words ‚Äòame‚Äô, ‚Äòhana‚Äô ‚Äòkawa‚Äô etc. that I mentioned above in katakana, are right as examples, but not right grammatically. Because these are not foreign words, they must be written in hiragana or kanji.

In the case of onomatopoeia, katakana should also be used. Onomatopoeia is the formation of words that imitate the sounds, actions, and even expressions of emotions related to the object in question. In Bengali, it means phonetic words, and imitative prepositions as terms. Examples: The cat‚Äôs call is mew mew (Japanese nyanya), the crow‚Äôs call is ka ka (Japanese kaka), the sound of rain is tip tip (Japanese potapota), the chest is pounding (Japanese dokidoki), the clock is ticking (Japanese kachikachi), etc.

Another thing to note about kanji is that not all letters or words have kanji characters. There are nearly 3,000 kanji used in Japanese names and common communication. In cases where kanji characters exist, the Japanese use kanji instead of hiragana. Interestingly, not all Japanese know all of the kanji. Only highly educated Japanese people can read and write entirely in kanji.

ABSENCE OF FUTURE TENSE

In Bengali and English, there are 3 types of tense: present, past, and future. But in Japanese, there is no specific verb form for the future. In Bengali, the suffixes ‚Äòbo‚Äô and ‚Äòbe‚Äô are added to the verb to turn it into the future tense (the structure of the two suffixes may change depending on the ‚ÄòPerson‚Äô). For example, ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßã, ‡¶∏‡ßá ‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá, ‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶®‡¶ø ‡¶Ü‡¶∏‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶®, etc. In English, to indicate future tense, the principal verb (to be) remains in the present tense, but before it, a specific auxiliary verb (to be) is used, such as, shall, or will. For example, I shall go. He will eat. He will come. But in Japanese, there is no provision for the future tense. The question is, how do the Japanese express the future tense? In Japanese, future verbs are expressed by expressing time with the present tense. For example, ‚ÄúAshita Nihon ni ikimasu‚Äù (‡¶Ü‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßÄ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶≤ ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßã). ‚ÄòIkimasu‚Äô is the present tense form of the verb, which means ‚Äòto go‚Äô. However, since the time factor ‚Äòashita‚Äô, which means ‚Äòtomorrow‚Äô, is used, it is clear that the verb is referring to the future. Nihon and Nippon are both Japanese names for the country, both have the same kanji. Collecting stamps was a hobby during my childhood. Japanese stamps did not have Japan written in English, but Nihon/Nippon in kanji. However, although the future tense verb does not have a separate form in Japanese, it effectively expresses future actions by expressing context and time. Even if there is no time, it can be understood with context. For example, when asked, ‚ÄúWho will go to Japan?‚Äù, I reply, ‚ÄúIkimasu‚Äù. This also shows that I have referred future tense.

PAST TENSE FOR ADJECTIVES

In Bengali and English, there is no past tense form for adjectives. The past tense is indicated by the auxiliary verbs ‚Äòwas‚Äô, ‚Äòwere‚Äô, etc. For example: ‚ÄúThere was a very good person‚Äù ‚Äì in this sentence, the adjective ‚Äògood‚Äô has no past form. In Japanese, the past tense form of adjectives is used in past tense sentences. For example: The Japanese translation of the sentence ‚ÄúThe event is enjoyable‚Äù is ‚Äúbangumi wa tanoshi desu‚Äù. ‚Äòbangumi‚Äô means event, ‚Äòtanoshi‚Äô means enjoyable. But the Japanese translation of the sentence ‚ÄòThe event was enjoyable‚Äô is ‚Äúbangumi wa tanoshikatta desu‚Äù. ‚ÄòTanoshi‚Äô is an adjective. Since it is a past event, the past tense form is given by adding ‚Äòkatta‚Äô to ‚Äòtanoshi‚Äô. The Japanese for ‚ÄúThe food was enjoyable‚Äù is ‚Äútabemono wa oishikatta desu‚Äù. ‚ÄòTabemono‚Äô means food, and ‚Äòoishi‚Äô means tasty, ‚Äòkatta‚Äô is added to indicate the past. Sometimes ‚Äòdatta‚Äô is also added. Not only that, there are both affirmative and negative words in the past tense of the adjective.

SENTENCE STRUCTURE

The fixed order of Japanese and English sentence structure is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). Though it is similar in the Bengali language too, it is not absolutely fixed. Sentences can be formed by changing the order of Subject, Object, Verb. Eminent writer and educationist Muhammad Zafar Iqbal gave a beautiful example in one of his works, describing this quality as elasticity. ‚Äú‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶ø‚Äù - the sentence is in the SOV format. But it can be written in various ways - ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶ø ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá, ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶ø ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá, ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶ø ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø, ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶ø, ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶ø ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø. That opportunity is not available in the Japanese ‚ÄúAishtemasu‚Äù or English ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù.

LACK OF PLURAL FORM

Nouns have distinct singular and plural forms in Bengali and English. In Bengali, the plural is expressed by the ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶≠‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø ‡¶∞‡¶æ, ‡¶è‡¶∞‡¶æ, ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶æ, ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶ø etc., and the collective words ‡¶∏‡¶¨, ‡¶¨‡ßÉ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶, ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶ø, ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ etc. are added to nouns. For example ‡¶õ‡¶æ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶∞‡¶æ, ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡ßü‡ßá‡¶∞‡¶æ, ‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶æ, ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶ø, ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶∏‡¶¨, ‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶ï‡¶¨‡ßÉ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶, ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶ø, ‡¶ó‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶™‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ. In English, the plural is indicated by adding s or es to a noun. However, although the duality of plurals is allowed in English, it is not so in Bengali. For example, in English, we say two birds, other guests, but in Bengali, we cannot say ‡¶¶‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶ñ‡¶ø‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶ø, ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶Ö‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶•‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßÉ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶. In Japanese, nouns do not have distinct singular and plural forms. Context is important in understanding whether a word refers to one or more things. Moreover, the plural is indicated by using a number or a numeral before the noun. Before looking at the examples, it is necessary to know the Japanese numerals: ichi (one), ni (two), san (three), shi (four), go (five), roku (six), shichi (seven), hachi (eight), ku (nine), ju (ten). These numerals are used differently for different types of objects or animals. For example, in the case of people (hito), ‚Äònin‚Äô is added to the number (like ‚Äò‡¶ú‡¶® in Bengali): 3 people = san nin hito, 8 people = hachi nin hito (but 2 people = futari hito). In the case of animals (dobotsu), ‚Äòbiki‚Äô is added to the number; roku biki no dobotsu, meaning 6 animals.

Unlike ‚Äò‡¶™‡¶¶‡¶æ‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶ï‚Äô(‡¶ü‡¶æ, ‡¶ü‡¶ø, ‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶æ) in Bengali and Article (the, a, an) in English, Japanese does not have them. Instead, it is often inferred from context.

MONTHS NAMED AFTER NUMERALS

Like the Bengali and Gregorian (which we mistakenly call the English) calendars, Japan also has 12 months. But while the 12 months in Bengali (Baishakh, Jaishtha, Ashadh, Shrawan, etc.) have different names, as do those in the Gregorian calendar (January, February, March, April, etc.), the months in Japan are not named in the same manner. Instead, they are named after numerals. The Japanese word for month is 'gatsu', so the names of their 12 months are respectively: Ichi Gatsu, Ni Gatsu, San Gatsu, Shi Gatsu, Go Gatsu, Roku Gatsu, Shichi Gatsu, Hachi Gatsu, Ku Gatsu, Ju Gatsu, Juichi Gatsu and Juni Gatsu. When translated into English, these stand for 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, etc. When a Bangladeshi friend told me in Japan, ‚ÄúI will go to the country in 4 months‚Äù, I was surprised! It will take four months to go to Bangladesh! Later I understood that he would go to the country in April.

CORRECT AND INCORRECT SYMBOLS

In Bengali and in many Western languages, including English, a check mark (‚úì) is usually used to indicate the correct answer and a cross (x) is used to indicate the incorrect answer. In Japanese, a circle (‚≠ï) is used to indicate the correct answer and a slash (/), cross (x), or tick (‚úì) is used to indicate the incorrect answer. The Japanese word for a circle is ‚Äòmaru‚Äô, and the cross is ‚Äòbatsu‚Äô.

NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE

In English script, there is a clear distinction between uppercase and lowercase forms; there are also rules and regulations for where to use uppercase and lowercase letters. There is no separate uppercase or lowercase form in the Bengali or Japanese alphabets. However, it is important to note that there is a fourth set of alphabets in Japanese, called ‚Äòromaji‚Äô. Romaji uses the Roman alphabet, i.e., the English alphabet. So, the Japanese words are written in the English alphabet. As a result, uppercase and lowercase letters have to be used according to English grammar. However, romaji is rarely used. Despite Bengali being our mother tongue, some people write Bengali on their mobile phones using English letters (and it‚Äôs unfair), and romaji also looks the same in Japanese.

ABSENCE OF THE ‡¶≤ ‡¶° ‡¶¢ SOUNDS AND LETTERS

There are no ‡¶≤ ‡¶° ‡¶¢ sounds or letters in Japanese. Where the ‡¶≤ sound is required, the Japanese use the letter ‚Äòr‚Äô. For example: ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶ø‡ßü‡¶æ=‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶ø‡ßü‡¶æ, ‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞‡¶ø‡ßü‡¶æ=‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞‡¶ø‡ßü‡¶æ, ‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶®=‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶®, ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂=‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∏‡ßÅ  etc. There is no ‚Äò‡¶™‚Äô or `P‚Äô sound in Arabic. When a Palestinian friend of mine, Wael, learned a little Bengali and said ‚Äò‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶∞‚Äô by showing me a pond, I didn't understand at first. Later I realized that in Arabic, the 'p' sound is pronounced with the letter 'b'. The Japanese continue the ‡¶° ‡¶¢ sound with their letter ‚Äò‡¶¶‚Äô(„Å†), while those who know English use 'd'. They don't even have the 't' (‡¶ü) sound, in which case they use ‚Äò‡¶§‚Äô („Åü). Although the English pronounce 'Tokyo' (‡¶ü‡ßã‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶ì) using the 't', the correct pronunciation is ‚Äò‡¶§‡ßã‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶ì‚Äô (Êù±‰∫¨). Similarly, not ‡¶ï‡¶ø‡ßü‡ßã‡¶ü‡ßã, but ‡¶ï‡¶ø‡ßü‡ßã‡¶§‡ßã.

EMPHASIS ON POLITENESS, RESPECT AND CONTEXT

Politeness and formality are very important for effective communication with the Japanese people. They have different levels of formality and politeness. Japanese has a complex system of honorifics, which are used to show respect or politeness to the person being spoken to. These include different verb endings, pronouns and titles depending on the social status and relationship between the speaker and the listener. Examples:

The common honorific suffixes for calling or addressing someone is by adding ‚Äòsan‚Äô to the end of a name. For example, ‡¶ú‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶¨ in Bengali and Mr. Ms. Mrs. in English. However, in Bengali and English, it is before the name and in Japanese, it is after the name. There is no gender difference. For example: Tanaka-san, Kawabe-san, Moriguchi-san. The same rule applies not only to Japanese people but also to foreigners. ‚ÄòSan‚Äô is used for people of any age, gender, or social status. The honorific title used for important guests or people of high social standing is 'sama'; the Japanese word for guest or customer is 'okiyaku', thus addressed as 'okiyakusama'. 'Kun' is used for boys and young men, often for someone of high status (such as a teacher to a student) or in a friendly, casual setting; e.g.: Rie-kun (Rie is the name of a female student). 'Chan' is used for children, close friends and sometimes pets, expressing affection and gentle feelings; e.g.: Shera-chan (Shera is the name of a girl). 'Sensei' is used for important dignitaries (teachers, professors, doctors and other professionals); e.g.: Ishibashi-sensei, Koga-sensei, Hamajima-sensei.

The suffix ‚Äòdesu‚Äô used after adjectives, nouns and verbs and ‚Äòmasu‚Äô used after verbs convey politeness. A level of politeness is maintained in requests. To say ‚Äòplease (give me/would you give me)‚Äô is Japanese people commonly use ‚Äòkudasai‚Äô, more politely ‚Äòkudasaimasu‚Äô, formally ‚Äòkudasaimasen ka‚Äô. ‚ÄòOnegai-shimasu‚Äô is a polite way of asking for something. Its English is equivalent to ‚Äòplease‚Äô or ‚Äòexcuse me‚Äô. To say sorry or to draw someone‚Äôs attention ‚ÄòSumimasen‚Äô is widely pronounced; ‚ÄòGomennesai‚Äô is uttered to beg pardon. Interestingly, the Japanese use ‚ÄòChotto‚Äô to mean ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡ßÅ in Bengali. For example: Chotto matte kudasai (‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡ßÅ ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶®, or please wait a moment).

These are just a few examples of the unique and interesting features of the Japanese language. The Japanese people highly respect their language, as it reflects their culture and identity. Many Japanese people actively work to preserve traditional forms of the language, such as the classical Japanese used in literature and poetry. The Japanese language has complex layers of politeness and formality, so people strive to use the language appropriately in different social contexts. Learning Japanese is seen as a lifelong pursuit, with many people continuing to study, acquire, and refine their language skills throughout their lives. Japanese literature and the arts, such as haiku, calligraphy, and traditional theatre, often highlight the beauty and expressiveness of the Japanese language. The Japanese people's deep appreciation of the complexity, cultural significance, and expressive power of language is evident in their daily interactions and cultural practices. It serves as a powerful tool for connecting people to their heritage and fostering a sense of national pride.

The first Shahid Minar (Martyr's Monument) abroad was built in Japan to commemorate Bangladesh‚Äôs language martyrs. The Shahid Minar was erected in 2005 in Ikebukuro Nishiguchi Park in the Metropolitan Art Space, the heart of Tokyo's cultural arena. The park is known as ‚ÄòShahid Minar Park‚Äô to expatriate Bengalis. This steel-built minaret is a smaller version of the Shahid Minar in Dhaka. A plaque in front of the Shahid Minar reads in Japanese, English and Bengali, ‚ÄòShahid Minar: A Minar of Love for Language.‚Äô

Once I was among a group of Nagoya University students who visited Toyota‚Äôs factory in the city. There we learnt that the founders of Toyota Company were the ‚ÄòToyoda‚Äô family (Sakichi Toyoda), but the company‚Äôs name is ‚ÄòToyota‚Äô. The reason is interesting. It takes 10 strokes of the pen to write the word ‚ÄòToyoda‚Äô in Japanese, whereas ‚ÄòToyota‚Äô uses only 8. In Japanese culture, 8 is considered a lucky number, so the name ‚ÄòToyota‚Äô was chosen. However, we were given a Toyota introductory booklet as a gift right after our arrival. The first page contains the company‚Äôs policies; a total of seven policies. I refer to the 1st and 2nd: honour the language and spirit of the laws of every nation and undertake open and fair corporate activities to be a good corporate citizen of the world. Respect the culture and customs of every nation and contribute to economic and social development through corporate activities in communities.

Although the Japanese are very serious about their professional work, they are fond of laughter as well. So, let us end on a lighter note. From the 10th to the 19th century, Japan had an elite class of warriors who were skilled in operating both swords and bows, called ‚Äòsamurai‚Äô. At that time, an emperor needed a new chief samurai, so he sent an announcement throughout the country that he was looking for a chief samurai. Three men showed up. The emperor asked the first samurai to show why he should be made chief samurai. The first samurai opened a matchbox and a small fly came out. He took out his sword and with one slash, the fly fell to the ground in two pieces. The emperor shouted, ‚ÄúExcellent! Excellent!‚Äù. The emperor then called the second samurai. The second samurai also opened a matchbox and a fly came out. He brandished his sword and the fly fell to the ground in four pieces. The emperor shouted, ‚ÄúGreat! Magnificent!‚Äù. The emperor then asked the third samurai for his performance. The third samurai also opened a matchbox and a fly came out. With lightning speed, his gleaming sword came out. Whew! In a flash, the room was filled with air. But to the utter surprise of the audience, the fly was still alive and buzzing around. The emperor, clearly disappointed, asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the use? The fly isn‚Äôt dead!‚Äù The third samurai smiled and said, ‚ÄúExcellency, please look closely, the fly has been circumcised!‚Äù

 Can India‚Äôs tax reforms be a blueprint for Bangladesh‚Äôs middle-class prosperity? ,"
                        
                        
                        India‚Äôs recent budget has introduced significant tax reforms aimed at alleviating the financial burden on the middle class. These measures are designed to increase disposable income, stimulate consumer spending, and foster economic growth. Bangladesh might find valuable lessons in adopting similar strategies to benefit its own middle-class population.

Three years ago, I approached Bangladesh‚Äôs then finance minister with a similar model, advocating for tax relief to empower the middle class and drive economic expansion. Unfortunately, I was unable to convince him at the time.

THE HIGHLIGHTS OF INDIA‚ÄôS TAX REFORMS

In the 2025 budget, the Indian government implemented several noteworthy changes:
‚Ä¢ Increased tax exemption limit: The income tax exemption threshold was raised from ‚Çπ700,000 to ‚Çπ1.2 million annually, ensuring that individuals earning up to ‚Çπ1.2 million (approximately $14,800) are not liable to pay any income tax.
‚Ä¢ Standard deduction enhancement: A standard deduction of ‚Çπ75,000 was introduced, further reducing taxable income for salaried individuals.
‚Ä¢ Revised tax slabs: The government restructured tax slabs to provide relief across various income brackets. For instance:
‚Ä¢ Incomes up to ‚Çπ400,000 are now tax-exempt.
‚Ä¢ ‚Çπ400,001 to ‚Çπ800,000 are taxed at 5 percent.
‚Ä¢ ‚Çπ800,001 to ‚Çπ1.2 million at 10 percent.
‚Ä¢ The highest slab of 30 percent applies to incomes above ‚Çπ2.4 million.

These reforms are estimated to benefit approximately 25-30 million taxpayers, allowing them to save about ‚Çπ100,000 annually. This increase in disposable income is expected to boost consumption in key sectors such as consumer goods, automobiles, and real estate.



POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR BANGLADESH

Bangladesh has experienced commendable economic growth; however, its tax structure remains a challenge. The country‚Äôs tax-to-GDP ratio has stagnated below 8 percent, significantly lower than India‚Äôs 17.9 percent. This limited tax base restricts the government‚Äôs capacity to invest in public services and infrastructure.

Adopting tax relief measures similar to India‚Äôs could yield several advantages for Bangladesh:
1. Enhanced disposable income: Reducing income tax rates or increasing exemption thresholds would leave more money in the hands of the middle class, boosting consumer spending.
2. Encouragement of savings and investments: Tax incentives for savings instruments and investments could promote financial security among citizens.
3. Broadening the tax base: Simplifying the tax system and reducing rates might encourage greater compliance, thereby expanding the tax base.
4. Economic stimulus: Increased consumer spending can drive demand in various sectors, leading to business growth and job creation.

CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS

While tax reforms can offer substantial benefits, Bangladesh must approach them cautiously:
‚Ä¢ Revenue implications: Tax cuts could lead to reduced government revenue in the short term. It‚Äôs essential to balance tax relief with fiscal responsibilities to ensure sustainable public spending.
‚Ä¢ Inflationary pressures: An increase in disposable income might lead to higher demand for goods and services, potentially causing inflation. Effective monetary policies would be necessary to manage this risk.
‚Ä¢ Administrative capacity: Implementing and managing new tax policies require a robust administrative framework. Investing in capacity building for tax authorities would be crucial.

India‚Äôs recent tax reforms offer a compelling case study in leveraging fiscal policy to stimulate economic growth and support the middle class. Bangladesh, aiming to strengthen its economy and uplift its middle-income population, could consider similar tax relief strategies. However, these policies must be tailored to Bangladesh‚Äôs unique economic context and implemented in a balanced and sustainable manner.

Three years ago, I attempted to introduce this vision to Bangladesh‚Äôs leadership, but it did not gain traction. Perhaps now, with India‚Äôs success as a model, there is a renewed opportunity.

" Chinese AI startup DeepSeek shakes tech industry, sends stocks plummeting ","
                        
                        
                        A new artificial intelligence, or AI, startup from China has sent shockwaves across the global tech industry, leading to one of the biggest stock market declines in recent history. The company, DeepSeek, has quickly risen to prominence with the launch of its AI assistant, which has become the most downloaded free app on Apple‚Äôs App Store in the United States, surpassing OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT.

The secret behind DeepSeek‚Äôs success lies in its AI model, R1, which offers high performance at a fraction of the cost of traditional AI systems. Unlike models that rely on high-end computing power, DeepSeek claims that R1 achieves similar efficiency while requiring significantly lower hardware resources.

This breakthrough has rattled investors, who are now questioning the future demand for expensive AI chips‚Äîtechnology that major firms like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google have collectively invested billions of dollars into.

TECH GIANTS LOSE BILLIONS

The financial markets reacted immediately to DeepSeek‚Äôs emergence, resulting in a dramatic selloff of tech stocks on Monday.

The biggest loser was Nvidia, the world‚Äôs leading supplier of AI chips, whose stock plummeted nearly 18 percent, marking one of the most significant single-day losses in stock market history.

Other tech giants also suffered major declines:

Microsoft shares dropped 9 percent, as the company has heavily invested in AI through its partnership with OpenAI.
Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, saw its stock fall 6 percent, reflecting concerns over its reliance on expensive AI models.
AMD and Intel, both prominent chip manufacturers, also witnessed significant declines due to fears that the demand for high-end AI chips could weaken.


WHAT‚ÄôS CAUSING THE PANIC?

Investors fear that if DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 model continues to perform efficiently on lower-end hardware, companies may no longer require expensive AI chips. If this trend takes hold, demand for Nvidia‚Äôs advanced GPUs and AI processors could shrink drastically, shaking the very foundation of the AI hardware market.

TEMPORARY OVERREACTION OR PERMANENT SHIFT?

Analysts remain divided on whether DeepSeek‚Äôs rise signals a short-term panic or a long-term industry shift.

Some market experts believe that the stock selloff is an overreaction and that:

US tech companies will not abandon their AI infrastructure for a Chinese startup due to regulatory restrictions, data privacy concerns, and their strong existing partnerships with Microsoft and Nvidia.
	DeepSeek‚Äôs claims still need independent verification, and the model‚Äôs ability to scale remains uncertain.
	High-end computing power is still necessary for training and deploying complex AI models, making it unlikely that DeepSeek‚Äôs approach will completely replace current AI technology.
Other analysts argue that DeepSeek‚Äôs model could fundamentally reshape the AI industry, citing the following reasons:

AI development no longer requires massive computing resources, making high-performance AI accessible at a lower cost.
	If DeepSeek‚Äôs model is scalable, it could challenge Western AI firms, much like how TikTok disrupted the dominance of US social media companies.
	The AI hardware market could contract, forcing chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel to rethink their long-term strategies.
IS AI POWER SHIFTING TO CHINA?

DeepSeek‚Äôs rapid ascent highlights the growing global competition in AI development. Until now, the AI industry has been dominated by Western firms like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. However, DeepSeek‚Äôs rise challenges the idea that AI progress requires billions in investment and vast computing power.

The company‚Äôs emergence also raises key geopolitical and economic questions:

Will DeepSeek expand globally, or will US and European regulators impose restrictions on its growth?
	How will tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia respond‚Äîby shifting to more lightweight AI models or doubling down on high-end AI infrastructure?
	Will AI chipmakers suffer a long-term decline, forcing them to adapt to a new market reality?
For now, the global tech community is closely monitoring DeepSeek‚Äôs next steps.

AI AT A CROSSROADS

DeepSeek‚Äôs breakthrough has set off a chain reaction across the tech industry, leading to market turmoil and a reassessment of AI‚Äôs future. If its approach to AI proves sustainable, it could disrupt traditional tech powerhouses and redefine how AI is developed, deployed, and utilised.

The next few months will be crucial as the industry waits to see whether DeepSeek‚Äôs success is a passing trend or a true revolution in AI. One thing is certain‚Äîthe world of artificial intelligence has entered a new and unpredictable era.

 The history of the 1969 Mass Upsurge ,"
                        
                        
                        On Jan 24, 1969, the movement to force the Ayub Khan regime from power gathered pace when young school student Matiur Rahman and a rickshaw puller were shot down by the police on the streets of Dhaka. It was one more sign of the regime‚Äôs increasing nervousness, especially in East Pakistan, where a popular uprising against a 10-year dictatorship was swiftly beginning to take shape. Ironically, the self-styled Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan and his government had just come through a raucous observance of what they called a Decade of Progress, the reference being to the ten years of Ayub‚Äôs grip on power.

In January 1969, all the portents of doom were there for the regime. All the prognostications pointed to the coming fall of a civil-military complex that was unable to hold back the popular urge for democracy in Pakistan. Four days prior to the murder of Matiur, the young Asaduzzaman had been killed in police fire. Desperation was at work, given that people in both East and West Pakistan were beginning to get restive, demonstrating every sign of wanting a change. In Dhaka, it was already becoming clear that the trial of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 34 other Bengalis in the Agartala Conspiracy Case was beginning to unravel.

Students of Dhaka University had come together to form the Sharbadoliyo Chhatra Shongram Parishad, determined to articulate their Eleven Points. And, of course, the Six Points publicly announced by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in February 1966 in Lahore formed the centerpiece of the revolt against entrenched authority. And into the picture came the fiery maverick Moulana Andul Hamid Khan Bhashani. Having in the early 1960s advised the country not to disturb Ayub owing to the latter‚Äôs growing closeness to Mao‚Äôs China, Bhashani was now a powerful voice in defence of the popular urge for a restoration of democracy.

In January 1969, East Pakistan was an image of unstoppable revolt. A thousand miles to the west, the other part of Pakistan devised its own, and similar, means of protest. Students in Peshawar, Karachi and Lahore, in a manner that was as unprecedented as it was welcome, voiced their gathering fury through the streets and broad avenues of the cities. Khan Abdul Wali Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter a lapsed prot√©g√© of Ayub Khan, were in prison, having injected energy into the demand for change. In effect, by the time the Mass Upsurge took a definitive shape in Dhaka, an entire country was out on the streets clamouring for change.

The demand for change had earlier been made more insistent through the entry into national politics by Air Marshal Asghar Khan and Justice SM Murshid. A rather surprised opposition, comprised of such politicians as Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, Chaudhry Mohammad Ali, Nurul Amin and Abul A‚Äôala Maududi, rose to the need of fast moving times through forming the Democratic Action Committee (DAC). The Ayub regime was eerily unable to comprehend the causes behind the uprising --- it was a sign of its inability to read the writing on the wall --- and the president went around asking his advisers why people were not grateful for the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù made in the ten years of his rule. He was already planning to seek a fresh term in office in 1970. Meanwhile, the incarcerated Bhutto too had made it known he would challenge his erstwhile mentor at the election.

Mass Upsurge Day in January 1969 was thus a defining moment in history, especially in the territory that would eventually emerge as the independent republic of Bangladesh. With demands increasingly being made for the withdrawal of the Agartala Case and the release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the regime felt unable to ward off the pressure. Its alienation was deep, and deepened when the academic Zoha was murdered in yet one more instance of reckless police action in East Pakistan. The entirety of East Pakistan was a loud symbol of protest, with Bhashani publicly advocating a policy of resistance against the regime. Ayub Khan and his ministers were compelled to reach out to the opposition. The DAC was asked to nominate its representatives to a round table conference in Rawalpindi in February.

The regime offered to free Mujib on parole to enable him to join the RTC, an offer the imprisoned Awami League chief rejected with disdain. On the streets of Dhaka and other cities in East Pakistan, students and citizens across the spectrum marched to demand his unconditional release, a demand echoed by an increasingly fiery Bhashani. The early signs of the regime‚Äôs coming capitulation emerged when Wali Khan and Bhutto were released in mid-February. In Dhaka, the government went for a self-inflicted blow on its fraying reputation when the army killed Sergeant Zahurul Haq, one of the Agartala case accused, in the cantonment. The flames of popular resistance leapt higher, forcing the chief presiding judge in the Agartala Case trial, SA Rahman, to flee to West Pakistan.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his co-accused were freed on Feb ww through an announcement in Dhaka by Vice Admiral AR Khan, the regime‚Äôs minister of defence. Mujib‚Äôs political ascendancy was complete when the next day, at a million-strong rally at the Race Course, he was publicly honoured as Bangabandhu --- friend of Bengal. On Feb 24 1969, he travelled to Rawalpindi to take his place at the RTC. Asked by newsmen at Chaklala airport for his comments on his changed circumstances, Bangabandhu had a six-word response: ‚ÄúYesterday a traitor, today a hero.‚Äù At the airport to welcome him was Asghar Khan.

The round table conference, following its inaugural session, was adjourned to early March, when Bangabandhu made it clear that while parliamentary elections and adult franchise were necessary, for the people of East Pakistan the future would come in the more substantive form of his Six Point programme of regional autonomy. Meanwhile, Bhutto and Bhashani, having decided to stay away from the RTC, sealed their own pact on what needed to be done. The RTC collapsed, albeit after Ayub Khan‚Äôs agreement to the restoration of parliamentary democracy and adult suffrage. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, outraged by the reluctance of his opposition colleagues to support his political position, pulled the Awami League out of the DAC and returned to Dhaka. The DAC, without the Bengali leader as part of it, quickly collapsed.

Interestingly, just how much of a change had come over Pakistan in those dying days of Ayub Khan‚Äôs authoritarian government could be understood by the offer of prime ministerial office he made to Bangabandhu over a private dinner. Predictably, Bangabandhu dismissed the offer out of hand. Meanwhile, the army, led by General Yahya Khan, was already manoeuvring to send Ayub out to pasture and seize power. It did not occur to the weakened Ayub that under the constitution his regime had framed in 1962, in the event of the death or incapacity or resignation of the President, power would pass into the hands of the speaker of the National Assembly. In the end, on Mar 25 1969, Mohammad Ayub Khan transferred power not to Speaker Abdul Jabbar Khan but to the commander-in-chief of the Pakistan army, General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan. The new general in power promptly clamped martial law on the country.

The rest is history. The Mass Upsurge of 1969 would open the floodgates to demands in East Pakistan --- and it did not matter that Pakistan was in the hands of its military once again --- for democracy proper and unfettered. That Pakistan was coming apart was a picture rapidly taking shape and form. In December 1969, speaking at the sixth anniversary observance of the death of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Bangabandhu let it be known that henceforth East Pakistan would be Bangladesh.

Bengali political aspirations reached a peak through the landslide victory of the Awami League at Pakistan‚Äôs first general elections in December 1970. Garnering a whopping 167 seats in a 313-member National Assembly, Bangabandu was emphatic in his pronouncements that Pakistan‚Äôs constitution would be based on his Six Points. Even as his party prepared to deliberate on the issue on the floor of parliament, intrigue was beginning to take sinister shape in Rawalpindi yet once more. ZA Bhutto‚Äôs Pakistan People‚Äôs Party, with 88 seats, refused to attend the assembly session scheduled in Dhaka for early March 1971.

Between Mar 15 and Mar 24, 1971, political negotiations involving the Yahya Khan junta, the Awami League and the PPP in Dhaka proved abortive given that the entrenched political-military combine based in Rawalpindi had already decided on military action against the Bengalis. Yahya Khan left Dhaka stealthily on the evening of Mar 25, having ordered the army to go into action against a militant Bengali nation. The outcome was a disaster for Pakistan. Bangladesh rose on the ashes of East Pakistan in December 1971; and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in prison in Pakistan since Mar 25 1971, returned home in triumph in January 1972.

It was an epic tale of Bengali aspirations being articulated and Bengali ambitions finding fulfilment. It all began with the Mass Upsurge taking shape in January 1969.

 Dhaka through an Eco-critical Lens ,"
                        
                        
                        When I moved to Dhaka as a student of literature, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel that I had stepped into the Waste Land. The stark imagery of desolation and decay in TS Eliot‚Äôs poem came alive around me, mirrored in the city‚Äôs polluted air, toxic rivers, and overcrowded streets. 

The barren landscapes Eliot wrote about seemed to echo Dhaka‚Äôs ecological and cultural disconnect, creating an overwhelming sense of loss and alienation. Through an Eco critical lens, this connection between The Waste Land and Dhaka‚Äôs environmental crisis becomes clearer. 

Like Eliot‚Äôs critique of modernity, Dhaka‚Äôs struggle is rooted in humanity‚Äôs estrangement from nature‚Äîa disconnection that manifests in pollution, unplanned urbanization, and a shrinking natural world. The environmental reality of Dhaka draws striking parallels to T.S. Eliot‚Äôs The Waste Land, a poem that portrays desolation and decay. Like the barren imagery in Eliot‚Äôs work, Dhaka‚Äôs air, water, and urban life reflect a deeper ecological and cultural disconnect.

Ranked among the most polluted cities globally, Dhaka frequently records Air Quality Index (AQI) levels above 300, indicating hazardous conditions. Recent reports show an AQI of 257, classified as ‚Äúvery unhealthy.‚Äù Vehicle emissions, industrial waste, and outdated transportation systems are the primary culprits. Residents in districts like Narayanganj and Gazipur may see their life expectancy reduced by over eight years due to prolonged exposure to pollutants. 

This stifling environment mirrors the imagery in The Waste Land, where air suffocates under human neglect. Water, often a symbol of life, has turned toxic in Dhaka. Rivers like the Buriganga and Turag are choked with industrial effluents and untreated sewage. Over 80% of the city‚Äôs surface water is unfit for human use, plagued by heavy metal contamination and waste dumping. This grim reality aligns with Eliot‚Äôs depiction of corrupted rivers, where life-giving waters become harbingers of destruction. 

The impact on public health is severe. Diseases like asthma, bronchitis, and cardiovascular issues have overwhelmed healthcare facilities. Exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) also affects children‚Äôs development and adults‚Äô cognitive abilities. Adding to this is the urban heat island effect, caused by dwindling green spaces and unregulated urbanization. Dhaka now endures harsher heat waves and frequent flooding. Greenery accounts for just 8% of the urban area‚Äîfar below the WHO-recommended 20-25%‚Äîexacerbating climate stress. 

Eco criticism, which explores the relationship between literature and the environment, offers a lens to understand Dhaka‚Äôs crisis. Like The Waste Land‚Äôs critique of modernity, Dhaka‚Äôs struggles stem from an anthropocentric mind-set that prioritises industrial growth over environmental health. This disconnection has led to ecological sterility, much like the spiritual desolation in Eliot‚Äôs poem. Despite these challenges, hope remains. 

Eliot‚Äôs poem suggests renewal through reconnection, a lesson Dhaka can embrace. Restoring rivers, curbing pollution, and revitalizing green spaces are essential steps. Policies must shift from reactive to proactive, focusing on sustainable urban planning and stricter pollution controls. 

Dhaka‚Äôs plight is a stark reminder that environmental crises are not just physical but deeply tied to cultural and spiritual health. By re-establishing harmony with nature, the city can transform from a ""waste land"" into a symbol of ecological and societal revival. This narrative is a call to action‚Äîfor Dhaka and beyond‚Äîto view environmental health as integral to our collective well-being.

 Bangladesh can become the US‚Äôs valuable trade partner ,"
                        
                        
                        Donald Trump‚Äôs potential return to the US presidency could present both challenges and opportunities for Bangladesh. Known for his transactional approach to foreign policy, Trump‚Äôs administration historically prioritized partnerships that demonstrated clear and immediate mutual benefits.

 For Bangladesh, this means positioning itself as a valuable technology partner, a reliable trade ally, and a strategic counter to Chinese influence in South Asia. Capitalizing on Geopolitics: Bangladesh‚Äôs Role in the Indo-Pacific During his first term, Trump‚Äôs foreign policy emphasized trade and economic pragmatism, especially in strategically significant regions. Bangladesh, with its proximity to India, Myanmar, and the Bay of Bengal, holds unique geopolitical importance.

 A Trump-led administration may see Bangladesh as a key ally in countering Chinese influence in South Asia. T o capitalize on this, Bangladesh can collaborate with the US on maritime security, anti-piracy operations, and digital infrastructure initiatives. Joining US-led frameworks like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) could also create economic opportunities while reinforcing its strategic alignment with US interests. Vietnam‚Äôs successful participation in initiatives like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) demonstrates how nations can leverage such alliances to attract US investment. 

Bangladesh can adopt a similar approach, signaling its commitment to cooperative, US-aligned strategies. Tech as the Catalyst: Positioning Bangladesh for US Partnership Bangladesh should focus on sectors aligned with US domestic priorities, such as cybersecurity, digital infrastructure, and tech services. 

Cybersecurity as a Growth Area The global demand for cybersecurity solutions offers an opportunity for Bangladesh to shine. By investing in specialized training programs, Bangladesh could create a skilled workforce that appeals to US companies facing talent shortages. For example, the Philippines has successfully trained professionals for international markets, attracting significant US investment in tech. 

Digital Outsourcing and Fintech Opportunities Positioning itself as a digital outsourcing hub could further strengthen ties with the US Bangladesh‚Äôs competitive cost structure, combined with its growing expertise in fintech, artificial intelligence, and data processing, makes it a compelling alternative to traditional outsourcing giants like India and the Philippines. Learning from Neighbors: Lessons from Vietnam and the Philippines Bangladesh can draw lessons from Vietnam‚Äôs success in attracting US investment through targeted incentives, improved infrastructure, and regulatory reforms. 

Vietnam‚Äôs promotion of its tech and manufacturing capabilities, coupled with its strategic importance in the region, has yielded significant economic benefits. Similarly, the Philippines has capitalized on reforms in labor standards and ethical sourcing to secure US partnerships in tech and outsourcing sectors. By aligning its labor practices with international standards and fostering investor-friendly policies, Bangladesh can unlock new opportunities for foreign direct investment (FDI). Homegrown Global Success Stories in Bangladesh‚Äôs Tech Industry Bangladesh‚Äôs tech ecosystem already boasts success stories like Pathao and bKash.

 Pathao, a rapidly growing ride-hailing and logistics company, has integrated digital payment solutions and attracted foreign investors. Similarly, bKash‚Äôs rise as a leading mobile financial services provider, with backing from global players like Alipay, highlights the sector‚Äôs potential. In telecommunications, Banglalink and Robi Axiata have invested in digital health platforms and high-speed networks. Collaborating with US firms in health tech and telecommunications could align Bangladesh with US goals for expanding digital infrastructure and reducing healthcare costs globally. 

As a Roadmap for US Engagement to enhance its appeal as a US partner, Bangladesh can take the some  steps in this regard. 

Develop Specialised Tech Zones

Establish dedicated zones with tailored infrastructure, streamlined regulations, and tax incentives to attract foreign tech companies. 

Invest in US-Aligned Skills Training

Expand programs like the Leveraging ICT for Growth, Employment, and Governance (LICT) Project to include cybersecurity and data analytics, partnering with US institutions to ensure global standards. 

Enhance Labor Standards and IP Protection

 Aligning with international labor and intellectual property standards can reassure US investors and attract ethical, long-term investments. 

Strengthen Trade Agreements

Negotiating trade deals that favor tech exports and digital services can ease market access for US companies operating in Bangladesh. 

Encourage Private Sector Partnerships

Facilitate collaborations between local startups and American firms in fintech, agritech, and health tech to foster a robust, collaborative ecosystem. Bangladesh stands at a pivotal moment in its relationship with the United States. 

By adopting targeted reforms and leveraging its tech potential, it can turn challenges into opportunities and foster a mutually beneficial partnership with a Trump-led administration. With strategic alignment, investment in digital infrastructure, and a focus on US priorities, Bangladesh can establish itself as a reliable partner in the Indo-Pacific region, ensuring shared growth and stability.

 Data analysis in school ,"
                        
                        
                        We live in a world overflowing with data. From tracking the steps we walk each day to global movements shaping economies, data is everywhere. It tells us stories, reveals patterns, and informs decisions. Yet, despite its ubiquity, our schools haven‚Äôt embraced teaching data analysis to children. Why is this essential skill‚Äîarguably as important as reading and arithmetic‚Äînot a core part of the curriculum?

The question is perplexing, especially when you consider that much of basic data analysis is no more complex than connecting dots or Colouring by numbers‚Äîthings even young kids can enjoy and understand.

THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE OF DATA

Think about it: data analysis is essentially storytelling with numbers. Consider a simple bar chart comparing how many apples versus oranges are eaten during lunch breaks. The tallest bar? That‚Äôs the plot twist‚Äî""Kids love apples more!"" It‚Äôs intuitive, visual, and fun.



Kids naturally engage with data without even realising it. They might count how many stickers they have or compare their scores on a game leaderboard. These are foundational skills for understanding data, but schools rarely connect these everyday experiences to structured learning.

PRIMARY DATA ANALYSIS: A SKILL FOR ALL AGES

Children encounter data daily‚Äîthey just don‚Äôt call it ""data."" Take a classroom survey: What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favourite animal? Compile the answers, tally them up, and create a chart. Voil√†, we‚Äôve just done data analysis!

Here‚Äôs a simple example kids could explore:

Task: Collect data on classmates' favorite colours.
	Action: Make a colourful bar chart or pie chart.
	Insight: ""Blue wins, but red is a close second!""
These are moments of discovery, and they‚Äôre magical because they‚Äôre powered by curiosity.

Even something as mundane as tracking weekly weather‚Äî""How many sunny days versus rainy ones?""‚Äîteaches kids to observe, record, and analyse. Data isn‚Äôt distant or abstract; it‚Äôs happening all around them.

THE BENEFITS OF INTRODUCING DATA ANALYSIS EARLY

Teaching data analysis early does more than build technical skills. It shapes how kids think and interact with the world.

Critical Thinking: Kids learn to ask meaningful questions like, ""Why do most students prefer apples over oranges?""
	Numeracy: Translating numbers into visuals makes maths less intimidating and more engaging.
	Decision-Making: Skills like evaluating patterns and making informed guesses translate into better decision-making.
Imagine a child using these skills to plan the best day for a school picnic by analysing sunny versus rainy days. They aren‚Äôt just playing; they‚Äôre becoming problem-solvers.

CHALLENGES IN THE CURRENT EDUCATION SYSTEM

If data analysis is so simple and valuable, why isn‚Äôt it taught widely? The reasons are surprisingly systemic:

Education still focuses on theoretical concepts over practical applications.
	There‚Äôs a misconception that data analysis requires advanced mathematical knowledge.
	Curriculums tend to lag behind real-world needs.
This leaves children underprepared for a world where data literacy is essential for even the most basic decisions.

COUNTERARGUMENT: IT‚ÄôS EASIER THAN IT SEEMS

Critics might argue, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt data analysis too complicated for kids?‚Äù The answer is a resounding no.

The simplest data analysis involves three basic steps:

Collecting: Gather data, like counting how many cars pass a school gate in 10 minutes.
	Visualising: Turn the numbers into a graph or chart.
	Interpreting: Ask, ""What do the numbers show us?""
Interactive tools like Google Sheets or educational apps make these steps engaging and accessible. A child can create their first pie chart within minutes‚Äîand feel like a scientist in the making.

GLOBAL TRENDS: WHO‚ÄôS GETTING IT RIGHT?

Some schools and countries are already reaping the benefits of integrating data literacy into classrooms.

Finland emphasises project-based learning, where students analyse local environmental data.
	Singapore incorporates real-world data into maths problems, like charting rainfall trends.
In these classrooms, data isn‚Äôt just a subject‚Äîit‚Äôs a tool to explore the world.

What if we could reimagine how data is taught? 

Instead of isolating it as a niche subject, let‚Äôs integrate it into everyday lessons:

Science: Measure plant growth rates and chart them over weeks.
Social Studies: Compare population statistics across countries using bar graphs.
Maths: Teach fractions using pie charts of classroom survey results.
Project-based learning could make data analysis a fun, collaborative adventure.

It‚Äôs time to stop treating data literacy as an optional skill and start recognizing it as foundational for the 21st century. Parents, teachers, and policymakers must advocate for change. Imagine a generation of children who can confidently decode the world around them through data.

PLANTING THE SEEDS OF DATA LITERACY

The journey towards incorporating data analysis in schools does not have to be daunting. By starting simple and connecting concepts to everyday experiences, we can equip children with the tools they need to thrive in a data-driven future.

It‚Äôs not just about numbers; it‚Äôs about empowering kids to see, understand, and shape the stories behind them. And what better way to prepare the next generation for tomorrow‚Äôs challenges than by planting these seeds today?

 Reforming the Constitution ,"
                        
                        
                        Governance system of Bangladesh is a Westminster type Parliamentary form of government. In this system Parliament is to play a major role in governing the country. All decisions of the state are taken in parliament after thorough scrutiny by representatives, elected by the people. All actions of the government are to be made accountable to the Parliament. 

In Bangladesh the Constitution and Rules of Procedure of Parliament were initially drafted almost in line with the same. But, in that also Prime Minister (PM) or the Chief Executive of the government was given an overriding power to have absolute control over Parliament. This has been done through inducting an article in the constitution (Article 70). This provision denied party members elected by people, known as Member of Parliament (MP), the right to differ with the party decision or whipping, during voting in parliament. That provides the PM guaranteed support of MPs of the party in decision making process. The government is formed by a majority of votes of MPs in Parliament. All other decisions of the Parliament are also based generally on simple majority votes, excepting amendments of the constitution, which needs two third majority. So, PM has the leverage of taking any decision unilaterally and getting it passed in Parliament. 

There could have been some checks and balance in the absolute control of Parliament by PM in case Party Chief, of the government party (CGP) and the PM elect would have been two different persons. Traditionally it never happened. So far, the party chief (CGP) always takes up the position of PM, whenever opportunity comes. 

In that context, The first recommendation for reform of the Constitution is, Chief of Government Party (CGP) and Prime Minister (PM) should not be the same person. 

Political Party as defined in the constitution

Another scope of creating a balance of power may emerge in case of a hung parliament where no party gets a majority. In that case a coalition government with participation of more than one party is formed. But that can be a rare coincidence. No system should be developed based on chance. 

The logic behind inclusion of Article 70 in the constitution was to provide stability to a government. It is argued that socio-economic situation in Bangladesh is not like United Kingdom (UK). In Bangladesh most of the MPs do not have sound financial or educational background. As such, they may not be able to hold high ethical standards needed to refrain themselves from the greed for money or power. Horse treading of MPs, which means taking them in support or against any resolution while voting in Parliament, is assumed possible, by giving bribe either in terms of money or lucrative position in government whatever suits the situation. That can make the functioning of the government very difficult. Also, the government remains vulnerable all the time as it may lose its majority in Parliament at any moment. Nobody can deny that the above consequences are quite possible in Bangladesh. Many countries having similar situations developed a compromise between total rigidity and complete flexibility. 

We would like to propose that MPs should be allowed to cross the floor, meaning that they be allowed to vote against the party decision or whipping (as is called officially) only whenever there is split in the party on any issue and split faction become at least one third in number of total MPs of that party. 

Article 70 of the constitution

This article should be amended accordingly. It will make horse treading a bit difficult and Parliament could be more functional. For the above suggestion on anti-defection, ‚ÄúTenth Schedule, Paragraph 3. Of the constitution of India‚Äù has been followed. 

Experience in history shows, in case one person holds the topmost position for a considerably long period of time that person tends to centralise power and becomes autocratic. As such, the constitution of many countries of the world restricts holding the top office by any person to a maximum of two. 

We like to suggest that no Head of Government (PM) can hold the office for more than two terms. This provision can be included in our reformed constitution. 

Before going to further reform proposals, we would like to suggest that the Fifteenth Amendment of the constitution should be repealed. 

This amendment introduced some provisions which were found not suitable, like elections to be held under the existing government. It has restricted many of the fundamental rights of people by imposing anti-people conditionalities and thereby increasing the control of the government. It also made unamendable almost a third of the constitution which is irrational. 

On repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment, the provisions for forming Caretaker Government (CG) for conducting elections would be reintroduced. 

The caretaker Government needs to be restored. Chief Adviser better not to be from judiciary as it hinders the independence and neutrality of the judiciary and could become an undesirable example of mixing of judiciary into politics and executive. 

In case the President can be made a consensus candidate as is proposed by electing with three fourth majority votes in the parliament, President could head the caretaker government. Art.58B, after repeal of 15th amendment can be altered accordingly. 

Repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment will also exclude art. 7A, which is not considered rational under the existing circumstances, and 7B, which binds the hands of future parliament and made almost one third of the constitution unamendable.

Repeal of the Fifteenth Amendment will also make free the freedom of association as per art. 38 from the anti-people restrictive conditions imposed to achieve a more grip of government on fundamental rights.

In support of repeal logic is, no present Parliament can restrict the authority of any future Parliament which has been done with the 15th amendment. Moreover, this amendment was passed by only an absolute or two third majority. Before the 15th amendment, there was a provision for a referendum too for acceptance. That step was by passed. This is a procedural mistake. Those could be strong ground for repeal of the said amendment. 

As per our present constitution, President play only ceremonial role. His appointment and removal in most cases are at the mercy of PM. He needs to work as per the dictates of the PM almost in all matters. Whatever independence he has been allowed as per the constitution is useless as his position is too vulnerable to stand beyond the desire of the PM. The urge now is to amend constitution to strike a golden means to achieve effective balance and sharing of constitutional powers between Prime Minister and President. 

Under present constitution President can be elected by a simple majority and can be impeached only by two third majority. Election of president as well as impeachment if the government party has two third majority vest in the whim of Prime Minister. We, propose President be elected by three fourth majority and can be impeached only by three fourth majority of member of parliament. This will include a wider role of Parliament in electing President and will ensure empowerment and stability of president as impeachment will be more difficult.

The Presidential Election and other things

Appointment of President should be not on a simple majority but with three fourth majority vote of the Parliament Members. That would allow a consensus candidate to become the President. Art.48A is to be amended to include three fourth majority votes for appointment of President.

Impeachment of President should also be made difficult to lessen his vulnerability by introducing the provision for three fourth majority vote of Parliament for that. Art. 52 of the constitution is to be amended accordingly.

The root crisis of power sharing between President and Prime Minister is article 48 (3) where except 2 (two) powers, i.e., appointment of Prime Minister and appointment of Chief Justice, all other functions, President must do on advice of Prime Minister. 

We would like to propose amendment of the said art. 48(3). This should be ‚ÄúIn the exercise of all his functions, like appointing the Prime Minister pursuant to clause (3) of article 56 and the Chief justice pursuant to clause (1) of article 95 and any other act as prescribed in the constitution, the President shall act in accordance with the laid procedure if any, or on his own judgement, in case no such procedures exist. ‚Äú

There should be provision for two deputy speakers one must be nominated/selected from opposition. Art.74 (1) should be amended to include those two deputy speakers to be appointed one each from Government party and opposition. 

The 16th amendment restoring 1972 original provision of impeachment of judges of Supreme Court by Parliament has already been nullified by Appellate Division and ""Supreme Judicial Council"" can be formed for removal of Supreme Court Judges and Election Commissioners. It is proposed that the same ‚ÄúSupreme Judicial Council‚Äô be utilized for removal of members of all other constructional bodies,

There shall be a self-sufficient ""Supreme Court Secretariat"" to assist the supreme court to administer the functions as vested under Art.109 of the constitution. The same secretariat should also handle the functions of the Supreme Court. The arrangement needs to be included in the constitution.

Article116 of the constitution is contradictory to Article 109 and as such may be considered superfluous and be omitted. As regards appointment of judges of the Supreme Court, Art.95 (2) (c) calls for making a law on the issue.

We propose the law for appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court as Article 95 (2) (c) should include a panel of senior supreme court judges selected by Chief Justice (CJ)to work as a search committee for forwarding recommendations to Chief Justice. The CJ should then pass on the same to the President for finalizing the appointment with his (CJ‚Äôs) recommendation. 

In respect of reserve seats for women in the Parliament, Art. 65. (3) of the constitution provides provision for fifty (50) seats to be filled exclusively by female candidates through proportional representation voting system through single transferable vote.

Keeping Art 65 (3), that is ‚Äòkeeping provisions for fifty (50) seats reserved for women to be filled exclusively by female candidates through proportional representation voting system intact‚Äô, we would like to propose, every political party contesting the election must ensure filing of nominations and have valid women candidates for at least ten percent (10%) of total candidates from that party. These women candidates will contest the election along with male candidates of other parties. While selecting candidates against seats exclusively reserved for women, those female candidates of the party who fought direct election but failed to win are to be given priority. This provision should be incorporated in the constitution.  

The above arrangement would exert pressure on the political parties to allow more women candidates for direct election with party nomination. At the same time, it would provide scope and incentive to women candidates for contesting direct election against normal seats. Hopefully, this arrangement will gradually reduce the necessity of reserved seats exclusively for women. 

President should be allowed to appoint election commissioners without advice of Prime Minister. A ""search committee"" should be formed by the President to prepare a Panel for EC members. In the search committee one third of the members must be nominated from the opposition. 

Election Commission (EC) must have full control over the Civil and Police administration during election and there must be 'default consequence‚Äô i.e., if any public servant does not comply with EC command EC will have own authority to suspend, transfer, dismiss, convict the perpetrator. All service rules must incorporate it.

Article126 of the constitution must incorporate that if any official does not obey the directives of EC during election, it shall have the authority to take appropriate action as deemed fit. 

Comptroller and auditor general, Public Service Commission must be appointed by a selection process independent from Prime Minister. 

A ‚Äòhigh-profile Committee‚Äô can be formed by the President consisting of representatives, (1) from judiciary, Supreme Court Judges, (retired or serving) two, (2) from parliament, MPs two (one from government party and another from opposition), (3) from bureaucracy (retired government official) one, (4) from civil society, two. Total of seven (7). 

The above body may be given the responsibility to finalise the nominations of candidates and forward that to the President with their recommendation. 

The said appointment process that ‚Äú a high-profile committee can be formed by the President consisting of representatives , (1) from judiciary, Supreme Court Judges, (retired or serving) two, from parliament , MPs two (one from government party another from opposition) , (3) from bureaucracy (retired government official) one, (4) from civil society, two. Total seven (7), ‚Äú may be followed for all the other constitutional bodies, like, Anti-corruption Commission, Human Rights Commission, Right to Information Commission, etc.   

In addition to the above we have a few more proposals for reforms to make the Standing Committees of Parliament more effective, and proposals on budget approval process. But that would require amendment of ‚ÄòRules of Procedure of Parliament.‚Äô For that we do not think this is the proper forum to raise those issues. The attention now is on the constitution and the proposal for reform on that. 

In the above we forwarded our views and suggestions on what should be done now to the constitution to make it more pro-people and to lessen the centralized control of a single person, PM. Our proposals aim at making parliament flexible enough to act free from absolute control of the PM. 

Also, we tried to make a power sharing arrangement between the President and the Prime Minister. This we did to strike a balance of state authority between the President and PM and thereby avoiding a situation where one person, the PM holds the sole authority on all the state functionaries, and thereby possess the scope of becoming an authoritarian ruler or autocrat.

 Remembering the Role of Indian Students in 1971 ,"
                        
                        
                        Over the last few months much has been written of the amazing role of students and other young people in the remarkable ‚ÄòMonsoon Revolution‚Äô of July and August 2024. It reminds me of the outstanding contribution made by Indian students when they worked among the millions of Bangladeshi refugees who had fled to India as a result of the brutal crackdown by the Pakistani armed forces and their local collaborators. 

 In 1971, I was responsible for the administration and coordination of OXFAM‚Äôs refugee relief programme which covered the supplementary needs-medical, sanitation, specialized feeding, clothing, blankets etc.- of about 600,000 refugees, men, women and children in over 50 refugee camps in Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, West Dinajpur, Bongaon and Barasat. At the beginning of the refugee relief work, OXFAM was of the opinion that it would be sensible and more cost effective if local personnel could be recruited rather than flying in many foreigners to assist in the relief work. For the previous 3 years, I had been working for OXFAM in Bihar, India, in a village development programme based at four Gandhian Ashrams. Through our Gandhian connections, we came to know that the daughter of a Gandhian leader, Narayan Desai, was studying for her MBBS at the Nil Ratan Sarkar (NRS) Medical College in Kolkata. One evening in May 1971, we met Sanghamaitra Desai, in the students‚Äô canteen of NRS when we discussed the possibility of medical students being allowed to work on rotation in some of the refugee camps. 

Sanghamaitra, known to us as ‚ÄòUma‚Äô and her student colleagues were able to obtain permission for students to work in the OXFAM supported camps on rotation. Later on students came from three other Kolkata medical colleges to work with OXFAM. The days were very long for the passionate young medical students. They would get up at about 4 a.m. to prepare snacks, sandwiches and bottles of drinking water for the day as well as all the necessary medical supplies needed for the day. They were then able to set out for the refugee camps soon after 6 a.m. every day. They would return after dark each day and then plan and prepare for the next day. After the Kolkata University authorities understood the value of the work being undertaken by the medical students, their work in the refugee camps was officially regarded as the practical social and preventive medicine part of the students‚Äô MBBS. The success of OXFAM‚Äôs initiative with the young students became well-known and we received monthly batches of students and doctors of some of the Mumbai Medical Colleges. Students also came from Cuttack Medical College, Odisha and the Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, Punjab. 

Young doctors were also sent to work with us from the Gujarat branch of the Indian Red Cross. In addition to the medical students involved in the relief work, volunteers came to assist with sanitation and feeding work as well as for assisting the setting up of impromptu schools in the camps. They came in batches from the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, Orissa, as well as Gandhi Ashram Veddchi and Lok Bharti, Sanosra, Bhavnagar, both in Gujarat. Students also came from Vidya Bhavan, Udaipur, Rajasthan. At the end of November 1971, an editorial in The Statesman newspaper acknowledged the contribution of the students in an editorial entitled, ‚ÄúServe While You Learn‚Äù. The editorial reads: ‚ÄúThe commendable enthusiasm with which thousands of medical students from Kashmir to Kerala have responded to the needs of East Bengal refugees suggests that a willingness to serve is by no means lacking even in the prevailing anarchy of Indian universities.

 American Peace Corps workers have never wanted for Indian helpers in their road-building projects; nor would Oxfam‚Äôs relief campaign in West Bengal refugee camps have been possible without the aid of young medical graduates from Maharashtra and Gujarat. If foreign organizations can persuade Indians to do constructive work, why cannot their own mentors do also? It is largely because of Oxfam‚Äôs representations that West Bengal medical colleges have now agreed to count an intern‚Äôs stint in a refugee camp as part of his training, but obviously this combination of academic learning and practical work needs to be extended on a far wider scale if universities are to live down Dr. P.D. Gajendragadkar‚Äôs criticism that they are irrelevant to ‚Äúthe problems of life and society.‚Äù 

This, then, is how I remember the remarkable contribution of Indian university students and volunteers in the tumultuous days of 1971. Those Indian students moved mountains in 1971 as, indeed, the Bangladeshi students and others have done and are still doing in 2024.

 How to understand and respect people with disabilities- some ‚Äòdo's and don‚Äôts‚Äô ,"
                        
                        
                        My elder brother, James, who was born in 1943 with a genetic chromosomal abnormality, Down Syndrome, and who had a severe learning disability, died in 1999 in the U.K. as a result of other people‚Äôs negligence.  He died of bronchial pneumonia because doctors who were treating him did not take the time and trouble to find out exactly what was wrong with him.  He had been suffering with diarrhoea and they treated him for that without properly examining him at the residential care home in which he lived.  He died because he was unable to communicate with the doctors and his carers supposedly trained to look after people with such difficulties.  His birthday, which he always celebrated with a lot of fun and laughter among friends, even going to a local pub for a drink, was December 3.  This date, therefore, has special significance for me and my sisters, because, in most countries of the world, December 3 is observed as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  

It is only right to ask ourselves if we ever take time to understand the problems, the challenges, the feelings and the aspirations of those people who live among us who, as a result of a disability or disabilities, find their lives more difficult to handle than most of us.  When we meet people with disabilities, due to our lack of knowledge, we often feel awkward and embarrassed as we do not know how to react, what to do, or what to say. I am writing down some practical advice which may help in the understanding of how people with disabilities feel. I draw on my own personal experience of growing up with a brother with a severe learning disability and later in life having a son, now 49 years old, with a similar disability. These experiences and knowing many other people with disabilities who have become close personal friends, have enriched my life and my work.

Having assisted, in 1990/91, in putting together the first preliminary draft of Bangladesh‚Äôs National Disability Policy, and having seen how slowly it made progress, I am well aware of how officialdom looks at the problems of the disabled. Although, 43 years ago, 1981 was observed as the International Year of Disabled Persons, the rights of persons with disabilities have always tended to be at the bottom of most governments‚Äô budget plans, and so, it can only be stressed that much more work has to be done. Having said that, I am pleased to see that the Government in Bangladesh has been taking a much closer interest in the difficulties faced by persons with disabilities and that the Disability Welfare Act 2001 was amended and strengthened in Parliament through the Disability Rights and Protection Act, 2013. In addition, ‚ÄúProtection of Persons with Neuro-developmental Disability Trust Act, 2013‚Äù was also enacted. Significantly, multilateral, bilateral and INGO donors have now adopted the slogans ‚ÄòLeave Noone Behind‚Äô and ‚ÄòDisability Inclusion‚Äô. 30 to 40 years ago all development programmes had to address issues related to women to be accepted by donors. So, very many years later, the rights of people with disabilities are now, at last, recognised! 

My work over the years has been enriched by many friends in Bangladesh and elsewhere who have disabilities, and all the time I try to focus on the person and not on the disability and hopefully what I write below ‚Äì and I first wrote most of these words 37 years ago - will help the Interim Government and government officials better understand what they have to do and how to relate to persons with disabilities. The best advice, however, is that if you do not know how to handle your relationship with a person with a disability, ask him or her for advice.  I hope these Do's and Don'ts will enrich the lives of those who read them and some of the millions of people with disabilities in Bangladesh.

-Don't treat a person with one disability as if she/he is disabled in other ways. People tend to talk in simple single syllable words to people who use wheelchairs, they shout at the deaf, and often address a blind person through someone else.
-Don't focus on a person's disability, focus on the person.
-Do ask if you can help- and how to help-if it looks as if help might be needed. You may be shy about offering help. The disabled person may also be shy about asking for it. And don't be offended if your help is not needed-persons with disabilities usually like to be as independent as possible. And don't be put off from offering your help at another time.
-Don't say ""I wouldn't try that if I were you""-a disabled person is likely to be the best judge of what she/he can or cannot do.
-Don't show pity and say, ""I don't know how you manage; I'd die if I couldn‚Äôt walk."" It is often hurtful and, under the guise of praise, reinforces the sense of being different.
-Do treat children with disabilities as normally as possible-including not allowing them to misbehave. Disabled children need to learn the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, in their own society, just as other children do.
-Do identify yourself straightaway. A blind person can't always place you by a 'hello'.  It's hard for her/him to reply warmly, 'hello', if she/he doesn't know who you are. So, give a name and context; ""Hello, it's Tasneem.  We met last week at Shahana‚Äôs house.""
-Do make a special effort to remember the name of a person who is blind. Beginning with her/his name is the only way of letting him know that you are talking to her/him.
-Don't feel shy about saying things like ""nice to see you"" to a blind person. She/he may even say it back. It's impossible to avoid words connected with seeing-blind people aren't self-conscious about it and needn‚Äôt be.
-Don't grab a blind person's arm unexpectedly. You'll startle her/him. In fact don't hold a blind person‚Äôs arm at all! Allow her/him to hold yours. She/he is then safely half a step behind you and so is forewarned of what your next move will be by the change in your position.
-Don't say ""here's a step‚Äù-say, ""step up"" or ""step down."" It's dangerous as well as embarrassing to be waving your foot in mid-air when the step actually leads down. Also if the step is exceptionally deep or shallow, do mention it.
         -Don't leave doors half open. Shut them all the way or open them flat against the wall. 
         -Don't exclude a blind person from television. It gives her/him access to a world familiar to her/his sighted friends.
-Don't exclude a blind friend from outdoor activities. Ask if she/he would like to shop with you instead of your doing it for her/him.
-Don't chase a child away from a person with a learning disability (often, wrongly, referred to as 'mentally retarded') who might approach her/him.  It only perpetuates the feeling that there is something to be afraid and ashamed of if she/he reaches out to touch a child, take her/his hand and turn it into a friendly handshake-deflecting the attention away from the child and on to yourself
-Don't be afraid of a person with a learning disability. Very few are violent-and if they are among people, you can assume that they are not violent. Avoidance and rejection are among the most commonly upsetting things to people with learning disabilities.
-Do be honest and keep promises. Don't assume that a person with a learning disability doesn't understand or remember what you've said. As an example, my son Neil, now 49 years old, who has a severe learning disability, has a very good memory, an amazing sense of direction and a great sense of humour.
-Do take time to listen to someone who is mentally ill-and don't assume that she/he has no knowledge or opinions of value.
-Don't express pity for parents of 'retarded' children-their child is just as precious to them as any child is to any parent.
-Don't give advice, except to point someone in the direction of professional help if none is being given and some help seems necessary.
-Do remember that any practical help you offer may need to be given for a long period.
-Don't tell a person who is mentally ill to ""pull themselves together"". If they could, they would.
-Don't grab hold of a wheelchair without being asked. The occupant can easily be thrown out by an inexpert enthusiast. Remember to warn her/him if you are going to turn the chair round quickly. In fact, it's thoughtful to tell her/him whatever your next move is going to be.
-Do check with the person in the wheelchair if the speed you are pushing her/him at is comfortable.  Too fast-it's unsettling. Too slow-it's plain boring.
-Don't lift the wheelchair by the armrests-they'll probably come out in your hands. Do remember that the person may find it hard to hear what you are merrily chattering about-and since your voice, coming from behind, may not compete well with traffic noise. Also, from her/his vantage point, she/he may not be able to see what you are pointing to.
-Do chat to a person in a stationary wheelchair with your head on the same level. It's embarrassing always literally to be ""looked down upon"" and uncomfortable always to be looking up.
-Do ask her/him how to get a wheelchair up or down a flight of stairs-there are often simple mechanisms or techniques which the disabled person will know.
-Do keep your face clearly visible when talking to a deaf person. Face the light. If you stand with your back to the light or window then you may be silhouetted, wiping out the details needed for lip reading. Don't move around-your deaf friend will miss words each time you turn your face.
-Do not distort your face exaggeratedly to 'help' a lip-reader. The subtle signs she/he watches out for will be swamped by such contortions. And don‚Äôt shout-it doesn‚Äôt help and can distort hearing aids.
-Do bear in mind that someone who is deaf may be nervous of going out in the dark.  Already denied one sense, she/he may be uneasy about being deprived of another. Indoors, make sure she/he has easy access to a safe light. And don't forget to take a torch if you go out at night with someone who is deaf-shine it on your face when you speak.
-Don't remain silent if you can't make out what a deaf person is trying to say, or if her/his hearing aid is making a whistling noise. Be frank. How else is she/he expected to know?
-Don't condescend. A deaf person's voice may sound strange. But there's no need to behave as if he she/he has a learning disability as well.
-Do play music. People who are deaf can ""hear"" the beat through the vibrations. Deaf teenagers love records and dancing at discos-the louder the music the better.

 Infrastructure alone can‚Äôt solve Dhaka‚Äôs traffic crisis ,"
                        
                        
                        Dhaka‚Äôs traffic gridlock has become one of the city‚Äôs defining frustrations.

While much of the blame is often directed at insufficient infrastructure and poor urban planning, a critical factor is frequently overlooked in discussions - the role of commuter behaviour. Despite the many government interventions we hear about‚Äîlike intelligent traffic lights and more regulated bus services‚Äîthe impact of these efforts will remain limited without addressing the habits of the people using the roads.

HOW COMMUTER HABITS WORSEN CONGESTION

Much of Dhaka‚Äôs congestion is due to commuters disregarding designated bus stops, boarding and alighting at any convenient point along the road. These random stops create choke points on busy streets, causing vehicles behind buses to form tailbacks that trigger a ripple effect that stretches traffic delays over hundreds of metres.

A single bus stopping for just one minute can delay hundreds of vehicles for up to 15 minutes, affecting traffic flow far beyond that initial pause. This ‚Äúanywhere goes mentality‚Äù isn‚Äôt limited to buses‚Äîcars and rickshaws frequently park at random locations, blocking lanes and forcing other vehicles to navigate around them.

These habits create an unpredictable traffic pattern, where unplanned stops and irregular crossings disrupt the road‚Äôs natural flow. Dhaka‚Äôs already dense traffic suffers immensely as a result, with each individual‚Äôs actions multiplying into a citywide gridlock.



THE LIMITS OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY

Government measures to reduce congestion‚Äîlike intelligent traffic lights, regulated bus systems, and new flyovers‚Äîare significant and necessary steps. Smart traffic lights, for example, adapt to real-time traffic flow to reduce wait times at intersections, and regulated buses can bring structure to Dhaka‚Äôs chaotic transport scene. However, these systems depend on consistent commuter behaviour to function effectively. Intelligent traffic lights require predictable vehicle patterns, while regulated buses need commuters to use designated stops. When people continue to flag down buses at any location or park cars in random spots, these technologies cannot function as intended.

While infrastructure improvements are crucial, they can only provide temporary relief unless they are paired with a shift in how people approach public transportation and road use.

WHAT IS MISSING FROM THE DISCOURSE?

Much of the media coverage on Dhaka‚Äôs traffic focuses on these interventions‚Äîpromising technology and structured solutions to address the congestion crisis. Yet, the role of commuter habits is rarely touched on. Public discussions frequently disregard the impact of individual choices that clog roads and disrupt order, assuming that technology alone will solve the problem.

To create a sustainable solution, it is crucial for both policymakers and the public to recognise the shared responsibility of maintaining a functional transport system. If Dhaka‚Äôs residents continue to expect buses and rickshaws to function as personal taxis, halting on-demand and parking anywhere, no amount of infrastructure will be enough to keep traffic flowing smoothly.

A PATH FORWARD

A sustainable solution to Dhaka‚Äôs traffic woes will require a dual approach: infrastructure development alongside efforts to foster responsible commuter habits. Public awareness campaigns could encourage the use of designated stops and highlight the importance of following road rules. By understanding and addressing the human aspect of traffic congestion, we can create a culture of road use that supports, rather than undermines, these technological interventions.

In the end, the solution to Dhaka‚Äôs traffic crisis isn‚Äôt just about building more roads or installing smarter traffic lights. It is about us‚Äîcommuters making conscious choices to contribute to a smoother traffic flow. By combining better infrastructure with a collective mindset shift, we can transform our roads from chaotic bottlenecks into a more manageable system for everyone.

 Empowering citizens ‚Äì the game-changing idea Bangladesh needs now! ,"
                        
                        
                        Imagine a world where the power of billions of eyes is harnessed to create a more just, accountable, and efficient society. We often overlook the most advanced, readily available surveillance system - human eyes coupled with human intelligence. While governments and organisations spend billions on cameras, sensors, and centralised systems, the untapped potential of citizen participation could revolutionise governance and societal accountability.

Let me tell you a story that inspired this idea.

A STORY FROM THE NETHERLANDS

In 2015, I was on a business trip to the Netherlands, driving through an impeccable road that connected a critical port. Impressed by the road‚Äôs perfect condition, I shared my admiration with my Dutch colleague. His response surprised me:

‚ÄúThese roads remain in excellent condition because citizens actively report any issues. If someone notices a pothole or damage and reports it to the authorities, they are rewarded.‚Äù

This simple yet effective system incentivised citizens to participate in maintaining infrastructure. By giving them a target (reporting problems) and a reward (monetary incentives), the government created a self-sustaining, people-powered surveillance network.

BRINGING THIS VISION TO BANGLADESH

Now imagine applying a similar concept to every corner of Bangladesh, not just for roads but for every system that touches daily life. Citizens frequently complain about parking violations, illegal construction, environmental hazards, and corruption. But these complaints often go unheard, filed in the wrong places, or abandoned when no action is taken.

Why not turn this frustration into action? What if:

¬∑        Every citizen becomes a vigilant partner in governance, equipped with an app to report violations?

¬∑        Authorities acted on verified reports, imposing fines or penalties on violators?

¬∑        A share of the fine or penalty was given to the reporting citizen as a reward?

This idea could create a virtuous cycle of accountability, citizen engagement, and revenue generation.

TACKLING PARKING MALPRACTICES

Take parking violations as a case in point. With a simple app:

¬∑        A citizen spots an illegally parked car.

¬∑        They capture a photo showing the violation and the vehicle‚Äôs number plate.

¬∑        The report is automatically sent to the relevant authority.

¬∑        If the violation is verified, a fine is imposed on the offender.

¬∑        A portion of that fine is credited to the citizen as their reward.

This approach solves multiple problems simultaneously:

¬∑        Citizens are motivated to keep public spaces orderly.

¬∑        Governments collect more revenue through fines.

¬∑        Social behaviour improves, fostering a culture of accountability.

SCALING THE IDEA

Parking is just the beginning. This model can extend to:

¬∑        Road Conditions: Reporting potholes, broken signals, or missing signage.

¬∑        Environmental Violations: Illegal waste dumping, pollution, or deforestation.

¬∑        Health & Safety Issues: Reporting food adulteration or unsafe building practices.

¬∑        Corruption Watch: Reporting bribery or misuse of public funds.

For example, farmers could report irrigation issues, students could highlight broken school facilities, and local businesses could flag tax evasion‚Äîall while earning rewards for their vigilance.

WHY THIS WORKS

Targets motivate participation. Giving citizens a clear role and responsibility ensures their involvement.

Incentives sustain engagement. Rewards encourage long-term participation and make governance a shared responsibility.

Technology enables scalability. Mobile apps and AI can make verification, tracking, and rewarding seamless.

Fines generate revenue to support the programme while rewarding participants.

THE POTENTIAL FOR BANGLADESH

Bangladesh, with its large, tech-savvy population, is uniquely positioned to lead this revolution. It already has a ready workforce. The millions of smartphone users in the country can become the government‚Äôs eyes and ears.

Increased fines can also be used to boost government revenue, funding better infrastructure and services.

And, hopefully, this could lead to a cultural shift as transforming complaints into action fosters a sense of ownership among citizens.

THE GLOBAL IMPLICATION

If this idea succeeds in Bangladesh, it can serve as a blueprint for the world. The model can adapt to any country, empowering citizens while reducing government dependency on costly surveillance systems.

THE CALL TO ACTION

Let‚Äôs stop looking elsewhere for solutions and start by empowering our own people. The eyes of Bangladesh are ready to build a more just, transparent, and accountable society.

All it takes is a commitment to trust citizens, reward their efforts, and act on their insights. The change begins with us. Let‚Äôs show the world how a small idea can create a ripple effect that transforms governance globally.

 Gen Z votes matter in the US election ,"
                        
                        
                        The 2024 US presidential elections are a moment of worry and anticipation for people across the world as they decide who will be the president of the world‚Äôs most powerful country for the next four years.

American youth, especially those graduating high school this year, should care about the election as their future is going to be directly impacted throughout their college years. This will affect student loans, housing, and the political climate of the US. Those eligible to vote should do so.

‚ÄúThe 15th Amendment (1870) extended voting rights to men of all races. The 19th Amendment (1920) prohibited the states from denying the vote on the basis of sex. The 24th Amendment (1964) sought to remove barriers to voting by prohibiting a poll tax. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 secured voting rights for adult citizens of all races and genders in the form of federal laws that enforced the amendments.,‚Äù according to the National Archives.

To qualify for voter registration in New York State, you must be a US citizen, be 18 years of age or older, be a resident of this state and the county, city or village for at least 30 days before the election, not be in prison for a felony conviction, not be adjudged mentally incompetent by a court, and not claim the right to vote elsewhere, according to the New York State election site.

According to Teen Vogue, a recent Harvard youth poll showed strong election enthusiasm among women, which may be a positive sign for Democrats and their nominee Kamala Harris.

The NAACP says that some of the key issues youth voters are interested in are climate change, healthcare, student debt, mental health resources, racial justice, and political reform. They want action to be taken in regard to these issues and are looking to make a better future for themselves.

Young people have been voting in historically high numbers in recent elections, according to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. The generation's turnout has increased. Now is the time for young Americans to exercise democratic rights and shape the future of the country.

Digital engagement with political content and greater access to information have encouraged more young people to vote.

Gen Z is more likely to be progressive and focus on the environment, the state of the economy, and the education system. It is also the most diverse in terms of race and ethnicity in the history of the US. As a cohort, they are sceptical of traditional politics and tactics and prefer candidates who promise big change. A lot of young people are worried about rising political tensions, violence, and misinformation and have many worries in mind.

Despite these concerns, we should vote anyway because that is how we ensure our voices are heard.

 Do we overhype the US election? ,"
                        
                        
                        The US presidential election is one of the most highly discussed events every four years, grabbing attention worldwide. The election determines the US president, often seen as one of the most influential leaders in the world. However, while the US election symbolises democratic norms, other American polls, like the midterm election of Congress's lower house ‚Äì the House of Representatives - hold less significance and do not substantially impact international politics.

The United States is considered the impetus of global democracy, a defender of free speech, human rights, and a free press. In theory, these values are considered the pillars of democracy. However, the reality of US influence in global democracy often reveals a more complex landscape, sometimes starkly contrasting its on-paper ideals.

Though it was considered the uncontested superpower after the fall of Soviet Russia in the last decade of the 20th century, academics and political scientists such as John Mearsheimer and realist and neo-realist thinkers often argue that the US does not hold superpower status anymore. The rise of China in the global economy has now challenged US supremacy. The realists now see international politics as the arena of great power rivalry, where influence is divided among a few dominant players. This power structure is increasingly framed as a divide between the ‚ÄòWest‚Äô, encompassing the US and its Western allies, and the ‚ÄòGlobal South‚Äô, a coalition of emerging powers focusing on China, Russia, and India.

Interestingly, in the Soviet era, this power struggle pitted the West against the East. After the fall of East Germany and then the rest of Soviet Russia, the axis of the rivalry pivoted. This is due to the geographical and strategic alignments. Russia again emerged as a formidable power to the East after the West's geographic and ideological boundaries ended due to shifts in Eastern Europe. When China came into the play, with India, Brazil and South Africa, creating BRICS, it formally reframed the two primary blocs of global dominance.

THE HYPE FOR THE US ELECTION

Then the question may arise: if the US no longer holds superpower status, why is there so much hype for the election?

Well, there are several key factors. Firstly, the United States has been viewed as a dominant player in global politics for a long time, with decisions made by its president significantly impacting international relations, trade, and security. As a result, the US election is not merely a national event; it reverberates worldwide. Additionally, the US makes its electoral process a subject of scrutiny and serves as a model for other democracies. This self-image heightens interest in the elections, prompting global observers to watch how democracy unfolds in the US. That also validates the president's power after a tight election win and serves as a model for how they want to be seen in the world.

As the president of the US holds nearly all the country‚Äôs executive power, it can be enlightening to look at the contest through the lens of behaviour personality theory. In the US, voters only really have a choice between two candidates due to the make-up of the system. As such, the focus of the global media is the behaviour of the candidates. For example, most of the voters will pick a president based on the performance of the current party in power. Because of that we eventually see candidates often attacking the personal characteristics of their opponents. Before Kamala Harris took on the Democratic nomination, Donald Trump directly attacked President Biden for not being physically and mentally fit. Ironically, the line of attack may have worked too well as the Democrats shifted to Kamala.

Since she entered the race, she has traded attacks and allegations back and forth with Trump. In many ways, the conflict hasn‚Äôt focused on political agendas or policies, but rather on their behaviour.

WHY DON‚ÄôT OTHER ELECTIONS DRAW AS MUCH ATTENTION?

In March 2023, it was clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping would secure a third term in office, as the National People's Congress (NPC) voted overwhelmingly to abolish the two-term limit in 2018, potentially allowing Xi to remain in power for life. This change made the contest for the Chinese premiership less attractive as it effectively signalled that Xi would stay in charge indefinitely, reinforcing expectations of his continued leadership. It is a similar case with Russia. Last March, Vladimir Putin secured his fifth term with 88 percent of the votes.

Then there is the case of India, the largest democracy in the world. When India held its 19th election last May, there was some stir in the realm of international politics. Though Narendra Modi became the prime minister for a third consecutive term, there was a significant push from the opposition Indian National Congress and its allies. Despite the scope and competitiveness of the polls, the international media attention given to the Indian election is much more limited than the US polls.

While the West and the Global South may be struggling over any number of issues at present, the lack of competitive polls in Russia and China and the smaller influence of India ensures that the US polls are the most closely tracked. Moreover, the extensive domestic and international media coverage amplifies the election's significance, framing it as a pivotal moment for global governance and norms.

TRUMP ADDS TO THE HYPE

While the explanation above shows how any US election can become a topic of worldwide interest, notable policy distinctions between the competitors or the behaviour of candidates can also add to the hype. And, of course, Trump is a lightning rod for both points.
The former US president has always had a knack for engaging the attention of the media. It was what powered him to his historic win against Hillary Clinton.

After Trump took the reins in 2017, the world saw significant changes in the global order. In two years, Trump changed the status quo in the Middle East by breaking the nuclear deal with Iran. There were also some developments in the relations between North Korea and its Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. Given his wild card reputation, many political scientists worried about the possibility of widespread war. But then, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump lost the White House to Joe Biden in 2020.

The possibility of Trump‚Äôs return raises questions about whether he will oversee another transformation of the global order.

Frankly, we know that, regardless of the election outcome, there will not be much change in US foreign policy, whether it is in Ukraine, the Middle East, Taiwan, or the South China Sea. Trump has, of course, commented on every situation in international politics, from the Ukraine war to the Middle East massacre of Palestinians. However, he could bring about another twist in the Iran-Israel conflict. Trump has also been talking for a long time about NATO's involvement in the Ukraine war.

During his last term, Trump spoke about his limited confidence in NATO, claiming 'he will not be paying for NATO if you (other countries) do not pay a similar amount of their GDP for the defence pact.

On the other hand, Kamala Harris has been adamant about NATO's strong support for Ukraine.

Another foreign policy talking point is the war in the Middle East, particularly Israel‚Äôs offensives in Gaza and Lebanon. Trump and Harris are both competing with each other to outdo their support for Israel. However, the deterioration in Washington‚Äôs relationship with Tehran under Trump‚Äôs tenure should be a point of note. The current Iran-Israel conflict has reached its peak due to direct attacks on each other‚Äôs territory. Trump‚Äôs firm stance against Iran may shift the calculus again.

While those of us outside the US may focus on foreign policy, Trump‚Äôs domestic politics are worth noting too. Perhaps most significant are the connections between his rhetoric and the ideology of white supremacy. Under his ‚ÄòMake America Great Again‚Äô slogan, Trump has been a determined, vocal, and strong supporter of anti-immigrant policies whereas Harris and the Democrats are lightly in favour of immigration.

There is also the question of abortion rights, which is likely to be an important issue during the election. Trump has justified his position as a vocal anti-abortion campaigner, but it remains to be seen whether this increases his share of the vote.

Due to his ability to focus and direct media attention, Trump has become a key factor in why US elections draw so many eyes.

 Unlocking the untapped potential of Bangladesh's secondary data market ,"
                        
                        
                        Artificial intelligence, or AI, and advanced research have become foundational to modern innovation, enabling breakthroughs across industries, from healthcare diagnostics to precision agriculture and smart city planning. However, at the heart of every powerful AI model lies one critical element - data.

In today‚Äôs landscape, data is often described as ‚Äúthe new oil‚Äù because it fuels AI and machine learning algorithms, offering insights and capabilities that would otherwise be unreachable. Without diverse, high-quality datasets, even the most sophisticated AI models are ineffective.

The global big data market has been experiencing impressive growth, driven by the surge in demand across industries for robust datasets to fuel advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning applications. 

According to Expert Market Research, or EMR, a leading market research and business consulting firm known for publishing over 100 research studies monthly, as of 2023, the big data market was valued at approximately $311.72 billion, with projections to reach a massive $1.09 trillion by 2032. This equates to a robust compound annual growth rate of around 14.9 percent over the forecast period. Key sectors contributing to this demand include healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and finance, where companies leverage large data volumes for predictive analytics, operational optimization, and customer insight generation.

Emerging economies like India and Brazil have already begun to harness their population-scale data as a valuable resource, demonstrating the potential to create exportable datasets that power international AI development.

Bangladesh stands at the forefront of this opportunity. With over 170 million people, a high population density, and rapid digital adoption, it is uniquely positioned to supply the data needed to meet global AI demands. This vast data reservoir spans sectors from agriculture to healthcare, where insights into local behaviours, health patterns, and market trends could be invaluable on the world stage. If managed strategically, Bangladesh has the potential to turn this underutilised data into a new, export-driven industry that could fuel both economic growth and digital transformation, establishing itself as a crucial player in the global data economy.



BANGLADESH‚ÄôS COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

Examining Bangladesh‚Äôs demographics, sector-specific data sources, and regional positioning can show why the country has a particular edge in data. This analysis reveals the unique potential Bangladesh holds and the factors differentiating it from other emerging data economies, like India and Indonesia.

Density: Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities globally, with over 1,200 people per square kilometre. For comparison, India has a density of around 484 people per square kilometre, while Indonesia stands at approximately 148 people per square kilometre.
	Urban concentration: Dhaka, Chattogram, and other rapidly urbanizing areas provide a consistent, high-volume data stream. In contrast, countries like Indonesia have significant geographical dispersal due to their archipelagic nature, presenting logistical challenges in data aggregation.
	Impact on sectoral data streams: High density in semi-urban and urban clusters enhances Bangladesh‚Äôs potential for healthcare data as high-density areas allow for the collection of real-time health data crucial for AI applications in disease tracking, predictive healthcare, and resource allocation. It can also be a robust source of consumer and behavioural data as dense urban settings yield high-resolution data on consumer habits, valuable for AI in retail, social media analysis, and behavioural economics‚Äîfields where AI needs vast and varied information.
	Young, digital-first population: Approximately 45 percent of Bangladesh‚Äôs population is under 25, creating a vast pool of digitally active users. For comparison, about 50 percent of the population in India is under 25 and around 42 percent of Indonesia‚Äôs population is under 25. Bangladesh‚Äôs digital engagement is also rising, with nearly 100 million internet users. A younger demographic is more inclined toward social media, e-commerce, and digital payments, generating vast data that is invaluable for training AI models in sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, and online behavioural tracking. Compared to other regional players, Bangladesh has one of the fastest-growing rates of mobile and internet penetration, projected to increase with infrastructural improvements in network accessibility.
	Potential for e-commerce data: E-commerce is expanding rapidly, creating streams of behavioural data that mirror user preferences, purchasing power, and regional trends, essential for AI-powered customer insights and personalisation.
SECTOR-SPECIFIC POTENTIAL

Agriculture: Bangladesh‚Äôs agrarian economy contributes about 13 percent to its GDP and employs nearly 40 percent of the workforce. This sector generates valuable data on crop patterns, soil quality, and weather, crucial for AI applications in precision agriculture and predictive modelling. Unlike some parts of India, where industrial data is more prominent, Bangladesh‚Äôs large smallholder farming base offers granular data on local agricultural trends, suitable for AI in food security and supply chain optimisation.
	Healthcare: The healthcare sector is rich with potential data on patient demographics, disease prevalence, and treatment patterns, particularly valuable for AI in public health and predictive diagnostics. Bangladesh‚Äôs health sector data is often anonymised and standardised, making it compatible with global data privacy standards, which is advantageous for international healthcare AI companies looking for rich, accessible data sources.
	Financial services: Microfinance and mobile banking are pivotal in Bangladesh, with mobile financial service, or MFS, providers like bKash leading mobile payment adoption. This creates a steady stream of transactional and behavioural data ideal for AI applications in financial inclusion, fraud detection, and risk assessment. Similar to Indonesia‚Äôs mobile-first financial landscape, Bangladesh‚Äôs digital financial transactions create high-resolution data across rural and urban demographics, giving AI developers nuanced insights into emerging-market financial behaviours.
CHALLENGES AND MARKET POSITIONING

Data privacy and regulation: Unlike India, where data localisation policies are stringent, Bangladesh has a more open regulatory framework, which may attract companies looking to access diverse datasets. However, as the sector grows, the country will need to bolster data privacy laws to meet international standards.
	Infrastructure and investment gaps: Bangladesh‚Äôs digital infrastructure is developing, but lacks the sophistication found in neighbouring countries like India, which has significant foreign investment in data storage and processing facilities. Government incentives and foreign partnerships could bridge this gap, establishing Bangladesh as a competitive data processing hub.
	Competitive edge in cost-effectiveness: Bangladesh offers a cost advantage compared to India and Indonesia, both in data processing labour and digital services. Lower operational costs can make Bangladesh an attractive outsourcing destination for data-related tasks like annotation, curation, and initial processing.
Bangladesh‚Äôs young, dense population and sector-specific data potential position it uniquely as a data provider in the global AI economy. The nation‚Äôs growth in digital adoption and mobile penetration, combined with a relatively low-cost structure and an emerging regulatory framework, makes it a highly competitive player in the data economy.

HOW TO DEVELOP A LOCAL DATA INDUSTRY

Developing a robust data-driven ecosystem requires a foundation of policies and infrastructure to facilitate effective data collection and management. A key recommendation is fostering partnerships between public agencies and private tech companies to establish a cohesive national framework. These partnerships can accelerate the digitisation of government records, encourage data-sharing agreements, and integrate data from multiple sectors like healthcare, agriculture, and commerce.

Data governance policies: To align with global data protection standards, Bangladesh needs clear policies on data privacy, anonymisation, and security. These policies would protect individual rights and increase trust among international partners. For example, adopting frameworks similar to the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in Europe or California‚Äôs California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, can ensure that Bangladeshi data meets international compliance standards, making it a viable player in global data exchange.
	Developing local data hubs and labs: Establishing local data hubs and innovation labs is essential for organising, categorising, and securing data, which would streamline data export and usage. These hubs could serve as centralised points for data processing, allowing for efficient labelling, cleaning, and storage that meets international standards.
	Public-private partnerships for skills development: Data hubs can also create a thriving job market in data processing, storage, and analytics. Collaboration with educational institutions can help build a workforce skilled in data science, data management, and cybersecurity.
HOW TO MAKE DATA A SELLABLE EXPORT

To make data a valuable export commodity, it‚Äôs crucial to prepare it to meet international requirements. Steps for processing data include cleaning, labelling, and structuring, which are necessary to make raw data accessible and usable for specific industries, such as healthcare, logistics, and urban planning.

Countries like India and Israel have shown the importance of data standardisation for export. By investing in processes that align with standards from organisations such as the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and the World Health Organization, or WHO, for health-related data, Bangladesh can build its reputation as a reliable data provider. Ensuring high data quality and compatibility increases its appeal to international buyers who require specific formats for AI training and analytics.

A practical way to position data for export is by organising it into ‚Äúdata packages‚Äù tailored to meet the needs of particular industries, such as retail, healthcare, and finance. These packages can be bundled by data type, region, or topic to attract global buyers who need curated, sector-specific information.

Partnering with global data marketplaces, such as Data Marketplace by IBM or Dawex, where raw data and processed insights are traded, could provide an additional avenue for Bangladesh to distribute its data assets internationally. These platforms facilitate transactions, giving Bangladeshi providers access to a broader market and enabling them to create revenue from data export while expanding global reach.

By building robust infrastructure, establishing governance policies, and creating tailored data products, Bangladesh can transform its vast population data into a high-value commodity that meets the needs of international industries. This approach can lay the groundwork for a sustainable data export industry that could contribute significantly to Bangladesh‚Äôs economic future.

BRANDING BANGLADESH AS A DATA DESTINATION

For Bangladesh to position itself as a global data destination, the government‚Äôs role is pivotal. Drawing lessons from countries like Singapore and Israel, Bangladesh could enact strategic policies that promote data-centric growth. Singapore, for example, has established data-friendly regulations, robust privacy frameworks, and incentives that encourage international firms to base their data operations there. Israel‚Äôs tech policies similarly created a fertile ground for its data-driven sectors, reinforcing the country's strength in exporting tech and data services.

Bangladesh can offer tax incentives, streamlined regulations, and lower setup costs to attract global companies looking to establish data processing centres. These incentives, coupled with the country‚Äôs competitive labour costs and an increasingly tech-savvy workforce, could make Bangladesh an attractive destination for international data operations.

Developing a local industry that specialises in data services‚Äîcuration, annotation, and analysis‚Äîcould elevate Bangladesh‚Äôs standing as a reliable data provider. This can include nurturing a skilled workforce to provide internationally compliant data services, exporting not only raw data but also trained experts and teams who offer high-quality data labelling and management services.

Investing in upskilling programs in data science, AI, and machine learning is essential to create a steady pipeline of skilled professionals. These programs could be in partnership with educational institutions and tech companies, allowing Bangladesh to foster a homegrown industry while attracting foreign clients.

CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

Leveraging data as a national resource aligns with Bangladesh‚Äôs ambitions of accelerating its economic growth. Embracing data as an export commodity offers Bangladesh an avenue to diversify its economy, create jobs, and cultivate expertise that can help the country become a strong player in the global data economy. In doing so, Bangladesh can pave the way toward a future where it is recognised as a technology-driven nation, propelling itself into the ranks of upper-middle-income countries and beyond.

Several challenges stand in the way of Bangladesh‚Äôs emergence as a data hub. Chief among them are concerns about data privacy, a lack of widespread data literacy, and infrastructural limitations. Addressing these challenges is critical to achieving international data handling standards, as potential clients prioritise secure data management.

Robust policies on data privacy and protection are vital. Without a strong regulatory framework, attracting international clients who need to ensure data security will be difficult. Building a data protection infrastructure comparable to GDPR or CCPA would elevate Bangladesh‚Äôs reputation as a safe data destination.

To make data a sustainable growth sector for Bangladesh, it is necessary to formalise data policy frameworks by establishing comprehensive data protection policies that safeguard data rights while encouraging foreign investment.

Partnering with international tech firms could also be a major help as collaboration with experienced tech companies can bridge technology gaps and allow Bangladesh to adopt best practices in data management and export. Partnerships with international tech firms or even neighbouring tech-driven countries like India can foster technology and knowledge transfer, building a resilient and competitive data export industry.

Data holds transformative potential for Bangladesh, aligning seamlessly with the nation's aspirations for economic advancement and upper-middle-income status. By recognising data as a valuable resource, Bangladesh can fuel job creation, attract foreign investment, and diversify its export base. Embracing data as a strategic asset positions the country not only to contribute meaningfully to the global data economy but also to foster sustainable, technology-driven growth domestically. This strategy could elevate Bangladesh‚Äôs global standing, establishing it as a competitive and trusted destination in the world‚Äôs rapidly evolving digital landscape.

 Pedalling through parallels: Reflecting on cross-country trips in the US and Malaysia ,"
                        
                        
                        Travelling through Malaysia by bicycle, from Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur, revealed a fascinating perspective on a country often overlooked in comparison with the global superpowers. However, Malaysia‚Äôs journey and modern-day society, in many ways, resonate with my cross-country riding experience during my 2012 US trip from Seattle to Washington, DC.

The paths these two nations have taken‚Äîmarked by diverse migration waves, urbanisation, cultural pluralism, and economic ambition‚Äîuncover striking parallels. My journey became not just a ride across miles, but an exploration of the shared ethos that connects these two nations.

Each year, we try to get away for a trip around mid-year, a routine that had almost slipped away this time. Accepting that we might not travel felt too much to bear, and so, we set off to Malaysia with our bicycles. It‚Äôs close by, with minimal visa hassles, and remains reasonably affordable. The journey started with a flight to Langkawi, one of Malaysia‚Äôs well-developed islands, especially geared toward tourists with its infrastructure, much like Bali in Indonesia, where we cycled a few years ago.

This time, the plan was the reverse journey‚Äîfrom Langkawi to Kuala Lumpur, covering about 550 kilometres in eight days, a leisurely pace with enough time to soak in the sights. Starting the trip meant boarding a ferry from the island to the mainland, an added delight.



A BACKBONE OF MIGRATION AND CULTURAL FUSION

Both Malaysia and the United States are products of migration. Malaysia‚Äôs early settlers from China, India, and surrounding Asian regions left indelible cultural marks that shaped its identity. These communities, each with distinct traditions and beliefs, have interwoven over time to create a unique cultural tapestry that, much like America‚Äôs, celebrates differences while forging a unified national identity. In both countries, migration was driven by opportunity and necessity‚Äîpioneers seeking a better life, just as immigrants in the US journeyed across continents.

Today, Malaysia continues to host millions of migrant workers who contribute to the nation‚Äôs growth, a trend reflected in the US, where immigrants have historically played a significant role in building the economy. Along the road, I met many workers from Bangladesh and other foreign countries, who have become a familiar presence in Malaysia‚Äôs small towns, much like the immigrant communities that characterise American life. Their presence is a reminder of the opportunities and challenges that migration brings to both countries, where people from all over the world seek new beginnings.

DIVERSITY AS A CORE NATIONAL VALUE

Malaysia, like the US, is a nation that holds diversity at its core. Though Islam is the official religion, Malaysia is home to substantial Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian communities. This vibrant mosaic of beliefs is integral to Malaysia‚Äôs national identity and resonates with the pluralism celebrated in American society, where freedom of religion remains a foundational value. Both nations emphasise tolerance and peaceful coexistence, where faith is a unifying thread connecting communities across cultural divides.

During the bicycle ride, we often stopped for water or rest, and it was impossible not to notice the beautiful mosques dotting the landscape‚Äîjust as churches do throughout the US. These places of worship not only stand as symbols of faith but also reflect Malaysia‚Äôs openness and hospitality. People were always willing to help, offering directions or a place to rest, regardless of religious background. The warmth and respect I encountered at these stops underscored Malaysia's commitment to inclusivity, where the shared spirit of humanity bridges differences and fosters connection.



PARALLEL PATHS OF DEVELOPMENT AND MODERNISATION

In Malaysia‚Äôs rapid urbanisation and industrial growth, we find reflections of America‚Äôs transformation. Cities like Kuala Lumpur are centres of opportunity, drawing people from rural areas and smaller towns‚Äîjust as urban migration transformed the United States in the 20th century. This rural-to-urban shift brings benefits and challenges in both countries, where balancing modernity and tradition becomes essential. Malaysia‚Äôs highways, infrastructure, and development projects, often funded by international partnerships, echo the American story of building modern roads and industries to connect people and facilitate economic growth.

As I cycled through different regions, the coexistence of modern highways with lush rural landscapes was striking. These roads symbolise Malaysia‚Äôs balance between rapid development and preservation of its natural heritage. Similar to the US‚Äôs scenic routes through towns and countryside, these roads tell a story of resilience, innovation, and the desire to connect every corner of the nation.



ECONOMIC GROWTH, CHALLENGES, AND A DRIVE FOR PROGRESS

Both Malaysia and the United States face the challenges of bridging socioeconomic divides, particularly between urban centres and rural communities. In Malaysia, the growth of the service, technology, and tourism industries has spurred economic growth, much like the US shift toward knowledge-based industries. However, both countries grapple with income inequality, a growing issue in fast-developing societies where urban prosperity often overshadows the struggles of rural areas. Malaysia‚Äôs smaller towns maintain a slower pace of life, where the benefits of modernisation sometimes take longer to reach.

As I travelled through these smaller towns, I was reminded of rural America, where resilience and community spirit often take precedence over the relentless drive for economic success. Both countries have also seen debates around equitable development, with grassroots movements advocating for more inclusive policies. In Malaysia, like in the United States, balancing growth with cultural and environmental preservation remains a key challenge for the future.



UNFALTERING PATRIOTISM AND NATIONAL PRIDE

In both Malaysia and the US, flags fly high and proud, symbolising a deep sense of national pride that is visible everywhere‚Äîfrom government buildings to small roadside stalls. The Malaysian flag is ever-present, echoing the patriotic displays seen across the United States. This shared expression of pride reflects a powerful connection to place and identity, transcending economic or social divides.

From a distance, it‚Äôs easy to mistake the Malaysian flag for the American one, especially for a first-time cyclist exploring Malaysia. The frequent presence of the flag in Malaysia reminded us of the similar displays of national pride found in the US, creating an unexpected bond between these two diverse nations.

Interestingly, only Bangladeshi workers seemed to recognize and respond to the Bangladeshi flag on our bikes, often waving in a friendly gesture of camaraderie. This felt similar to experiences in the US, where locals are quick to recognise and respond to their own flag but may not easily identify others.

Flags in both nations serve as reminders of the ideals each country strives to uphold‚Äîunity, diversity, and progress. This patriotic spirit brings communities together, as people in both Malaysia and the US take pride in the freedoms and opportunities their countries offer.



A SHARED JOURNEY OF RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION

After eight days, we arrived in Kuala Lumpur with a renewed respect for Malaysia‚Äîa country whose story parallels the American journey in remarkable ways. From waves of migration and cultural diversity to economic ambition and social resilience, both nations have forged unique paths that echo each other‚Äôs values. Our journey through Malaysia unveiled a place where modernity meets tradition, where diversity is celebrated as a strength, and where ambition drives growth‚Äîa sentiment that feels both deeply American and uniquely Malaysian.

Travelling by bicycle, the slowest form of transport offers an extraordinary opportunity to truly immerse oneself in a place. The gradual shift in landscapes allows us to absorb every detail, revealing nuances that faster travel would miss. Each stop uncovers stories, and the steady pace of cycling makes you a part of them. We felt that both in Malaysia and the US, these parallels underscore a shared human experience that transcends borders. Through these explorations, we found not only the beauty of Malaysia but also a common narrative of resilience, unity, and the pursuit of a brighter future.

And with heartfelt gratitude, we say 'Terima Kasih' to Malaysia for embracing hundreds of thousands of our countrymen, allowing them to call this beautiful land their home.

" To transform Bangladesh, we must lead by example ","
                        
                        
                        Bangladesh is witnessing a pivotal moment, with a seismic shift in political power leading to the installation of a new administration. Promising a return to the nation's golden era, the new leadership has caught everyone's attention. But are they at risk of repeating the same mistakes that have long plagued governance? Can leaders drawn from grassroots movements or non-government organisations successfully steer the bureaucratic machinery, or will they eventually become trapped in the very system they sought to reform?
There is a high likelihood that this new leadership, too, will end up as prisoners of the old administration's practices. Why? Because they appear to be focusing on reforming or punishing individuals and groups rather than tackling the fundamental issues with the system itself. This is a hallmark of the old guard - an approach that gets stuck in a cycle of assigning blame and seeking scapegoats, while the real issues remain unaddressed.
Instead, the new administration must break this cycle. They need to lead by example, starting with transparency and accountability in every step they take. The most impactful reforms are not about reshuffling people, but about changing the processes that govern them. Real change will come when they systematically address the underlying mechanisms that perpetuate inefficiency, opacity, and corruption.
For instance, the events of the first three days following the shift in power‚Äîsuch as the mass release of criminals from jails‚Äîraise questions that must be addressed openly. The administration must take responsibility for these actions and communicate clearly, showing accountability. Every decision, every appointment needs to be justified, with the public actively engaged in the process. This isn't just about optics; it's about building trust through consistent, transparent actions.
Moreover, appointments must reflect meritocracy. A health ministry needs a health expert at its helm; an IT ministry deserves an IT professional. The public will quickly lose faith if they see individuals without relevant expertise being appointed. Without addressing these fundamental flaws in the process, the new administration risks becoming indistinguishable from the old one.
To truly differentiate themselves, they must focus on systematic reforms‚Äînot by fixating on who did what in the past, but by redefining how the system itself functions. Only then can the promise of transformation move from rhetoric to reality.
A NEW MINDSET
The new administration must adopt a service-oriented mindset, seeing themselves not as rulers, but as service providers to the people. Leaders should recognise that they are employees paid by citizens, accountable to them at every turn. This means prioritising public welfare above all else and constantly striving for success and progress.
To achieve this, the administration should:
Answer to the people - Treat the people as stakeholders and engage with them as service beneficiaries. Every day should bring some level of success or progress that can be demonstrated to the public.
Provide a clear roadmap: Provide a detailed, transparent roadmap that outlines goals, milestones, and timelines. The public should have access to this plan and be involved in discussions regarding it.
Account for every action: Leaders must answer for every action, delay, or decision. Successes should be celebrated with the public, while setbacks should be openly acknowledged, with explanations provided on how they will be addressed. By being upfront, the administration can build credibility and trust.
LEAD BY EXAMPLE
To effectively implement a mindset of service and accountability by leading through examples, the administration can follow these steps:
Adopt daily public briefings: Conduct daily briefings where key actions, decisions, and progress are communicated to the public. This could be through press conferences, social media updates, or official bulletins. Transparency in communication fosters a culture of openness and helps maintain the public's trust.
Create a public dashboard for progress tracking: Develop an online dashboard that the public can access to see the progress of various initiatives. Include milestones, timelines, and real-time status updates. This makes the administration‚Äôs efforts tangible and demonstrates commitment to delivering on promises. Such a tool should be easy to navigate, allowing citizens to track the government‚Äôs progress in critical areas like infrastructure, health, and education.
Establish a feedback mechanism for citizens: Create an effective platform where citizens can provide feedback on government projects, policies, and services. A dedicated team should analyse this feedback, and actionable suggestions should be taken seriously. This mechanism ensures that the people‚Äôs voice will shape governance and helps leaders stay connected to realities on the ground.
Publicise policy rationale: For every major policy decision, provide a detailed public rationale. Publish documents and host open forums to explain the reasoning behind decisions, the expected impact, and how it aligns with public welfare. By doing so, leaders demonstrate that their actions are guided by logic and public interest, not by personal or political motivations.
Implement a service training program for officials: Train all government officials in public service values, communication, and transparency. Emphasise the importance of accountability and viewing themselves as servants of the people. This can be done through workshops, seminars, and leadership programs that focus on instilling a service-first mindset.
Lead by example to reinforce accountability: When a leader or official makes an error, use it as an opportunity to lead by example for accountability. Publicly acknowledge the mistake, outline corrective actions, and demonstrate what is being done to prevent recurrence. For instance, if there was a miscommunication leading to public dissatisfaction, the official involved should address the issue directly, providing both a genuine apology and a solution.
Foster inter-ministerial collaboration for better service delivery: Encourage collaboration among ministries to solve cross-cutting issues. For example, a project on improving healthcare facilities will require inputs from health, infrastructure, finance, and technology departments. Establishing inter-ministerial task forces with a clear mandate and regular progress reporting ensures better coordination and service delivery.
Engage local communities in decision-making: Whenever there is a new policy or a major development project, engage local communities in consultation meetings. By involving those directly affected, the administration can ensure that policies are grounded in local needs. For example, before constructing new roads or infrastructure, hold town hall meetings to gather input from residents and adjust plans accordingly.
Establish a performance evaluation system for officials: Create a transparent performance evaluation system to assess the effectiveness of government officials. Metrics could include service delivery, citizen satisfaction, responsiveness, and transparency. Make the evaluation results public, celebrating high performers and helping others improve through targeted training.
Demonstrate personal commitment: Leaders should consistently demonstrate the values they advocate, setting a strong precedent through their own behaviour. This could mean disclosing personal assets to demonstrate financial transparency, adhering to strict ethical standards, and being visible in their efforts to engage with the public. When citizens see their leaders practicing what they preach, they are more likely to believe in the transformation narrative.
CONCLUSION
To genuinely bring about a golden era of progress and prosperity, the new administration must break free from the legacy of superficial changes. Systemic reforms‚Äîanchored in transparency, meritocracy, and accountability‚Äîwill be the true differentiators. Leading by example, fostering a mindset of public service, and engaging citizens at every step will transform rhetoric into lasting, meaningful progress. By addressing the root causes of inefficiency and corruption, the new leadership has the potential to deliver on their promises and truly reshape governance for the better.

 Islamic songs were performed at a Durga Puja event. Was it incidental or planned? ,"
                        
                        
                        Durga Puja, the biggest religious festival for the Bengali Hindu community, has now come to a close. After the fall of the previous Awami regime in the face of the Anti-discrimination Student Movement, there was a different atmosphere for this year's Puja.
The interim government has extended the public holiday by declaring Thursday, Oct 10, a holiday by executive order to make this year's celebrations more joyful. In conjunction with the weekend and the Dashami public holiday on Sunday, this meant there were four consecutive days off for officegoers.
Since the mass awakening in July, there have been some isolated incidents of attacks on Hindu communities in different parts of the country. Student coordinators have alleged that, at least in some cases, the supporters of the fallen dictatorship have perpetrated these incidents to create communal unrest. There were attempts by some nefarious quarters to create communal unrest through such activities during previous Durga Pujas to allegedly gain a political advantage. Therefore, the interim government and the main political parties of the country are keeping a watchful eye to prevent any unwanted incidents during the Puja celebrations.
Though the celebrations have been peaceful on the whole thanks to careful vigilance, one incident has stirred controversy. On Thursday, an organisation named 'Chattogram Cultural Academy' performed two songs at a cultural event organised at the historic JM Sen Hall by the Chattogram Hindu community. The two songs were the famous Baul song 'Age Ki Sundar Din Kataitam' by Baul Samrat Abdul Karim and 'Shudhu Mosalmaner Lagi Aseniko Islam' written by Principal Chowdhury Abdul Halim.
After the performance, it came to light that the performance had been approved by Sajal Dutta, joint secretary of the Mahanagar Puja Celebration Committee. At the end of the performance, the singers were seen to thank the organisers for inviting them. Similarly, the programme presenter was also seen to applaud the singers for performing the music of a non-sectarian Bangladesh. The focus of the first song was on Hindu-Muslim harmony, while in my opinion, the second song highlights Islam's provision of equality for all religions.
However, other members of the Mahanagar Puja Celebration Committee later said that the performers had asked to perform at the event, not the other way around. Though the singers had Dutta's approval, a section of the audience did not take their performance well.
After a video of the incident went viral on social media, displeasure was expressed from various quarters. Based on the assumption that the performing organisation was pro-Jamaat, a campaign began to propagate the idea that activists from the Jamaat e-Islami and Islamic Chhatra Shibir went to the Puja pavilion and forced the performance of an Islamic song. This was propagated not only by people from the Hindu community but also by many who dislike Jamaat-Shibir politics. The local administration intervened to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Police have already arrested two music performers. However, there is no trace of Dutta, who approved the performance.
One of the main narratives constructed by the fallen autocracy to take and retain power was their stance against Islamic fundamentalism and militancy ‚Äì which they propagated both at home and abroad. By this, they primarily meant the Jamaat-Shibir, but the BNP was also implicated as their ‚Äòclose ally‚Äô. This had been their main weapon to stay in power, making use of the West‚Äôs Islamophobia. Because of the anti-India stance of the nationalist and Islamist forces of the country, Bangladesh‚Äôs neighbour also wanted to see the fallen regime stay in power at any cost.
Even after the recent popular uprising toppled the dictatorship, their followers are believed to be attempting sectarian violence in various parts of the country to try and make the country's transformation appear to the West as an Islamist coup. Politicians and the media in India have also continued attempting to portray the country's changeover in the same vein. They aim to antagonise the Western world and turn it against the new government.
Undoubtedly, the Islamic and nationalist forces are now in a much stronger position in this new, post-uprising Bangladesh. However, this does not mean that there has been or is going to be the empowerment of any forces like the IS or the Taliban. The main reason why the narrative of the fallen autocracy and its patron, Indian Brahmanism, has not succeeded so far is that Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus is well-known across the world as an eminently secular personality. Moreover, I believe those appointed to the interim government formed under his leadership are almost all in the same vein.
The second reason why this strategy has not succeeded so far is that the country's Islamic and nationalist forces were careful not to allow the creation of any communal strife in the country since the changeover in power. This prevented the old regime from implementing its familiar strategy.
Despite the vigilance and awareness at the leadership level, it is not unusual for many ordinary activists and supporters to have an inadequate understanding of the situation. Therefore, we should ask ‚Äì is the Chattogram Puja pavilion incident just an expression of innocent Hindu-Muslim friendship and harmony at the personal level, or a trap as part of a wider plot?
Whether they realise it or not, there is no denying that this incident has given the fallen autocracy and its Brahminical patrons a fresh tool to lay out a narrative of minority oppression in this country. It is already understood that they are trying to make the best use of this weapon by flooding the media and social media. Unfortunately, however, some forces associated with the student movement are also seen, due to their Jamaat-Shibir phobia, to join this propaganda and serve the purpose of the fallen dictatorship and its patrons.
Communal harmony is very important for the overall stability and progress of this country. The imperialist powers will always try to materialise their own interests by creating instability and division in Bangladesh. Therefore, it is difficult to say that they will not try again to use similar incidents in the future to try and destroy communal harmony. As such, everyone must take care and remain vigilant in this regard.

 The treacherous path ahead ,"
                        
                        
                        Mike Tyson‚Äôs claim, ‚ÄúEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,‚Äù captures a compelling truth about strategy and resilience.

It highlights that no matter how well-prepared or thought-out a plan may be, unforeseen challenges can completely disrupt it. In the heat of the moment‚Äîwhether in the boxing ring, life or economic challenges‚Äîthe ability to adapt, respond to adversity, and stay focused is often more important than the overall plan itself. Tyson‚Äôs quote highlights the unpredictable nature of challenges and the necessity of being prepared for the unexpected.

The current financial crisis in Bangladesh is undeniably severe, with the banking system facing a capital shortfall estimated between $30 and $50 billion, with classified and distressed assets accounting for over 30 percent and growing, given the current economic uncertainties including the cost of funding. Those who have lived through significant financial crises like the SNL crisis of the early 1990s, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the Latin American Crisis, and the 2008 global financial collapse understand that these situations require not only substantial capital infusions but also highly coordinated, robust policy interventions. The path to resolving these challenges is full of execution risks, with limited room for error.

Bangladesh‚Äôs crisis is more complex and multi-dimensional than previous ones that we have observed. Like a patient in the ICU facing multiple organ failures, the banking system may soon be on life support if it isn‚Äôt already. Stabilising the situation requires not just experienced technocrats and orthodox thinking, but a team of highly skilled, experienced professionals with execution skills who understand the local reality, the dynamic interrelationships and consequences triggered by each policy decision, and uncontrollable factors. We must prioritise which parts of the economy can be saved immediately and which areas might require short-term sacrifices to ensure long-term survival. Attempting to address all these conflicting challenges simultaneously with limited capital will likely lead to failure.



For those in the finance or investment industry, there is no space for pretence. Performance is evaluated daily through ‚Äúmark to market,‚Äù a real-time measurement of financial standings that can, at times, send shockwaves through the entire financial system at times of market stress. The same level of transparency and discipline is essential in managing this crisis.

Bangladesh‚Äôs economic challenges must be clearly articulated with measurable data, and the solutions must be executed with precision and realistic planning. A measurable, adaptable strategy is needed, with room for adjustment as the situation evolves. Conflicting priorities‚Äîsuch as stabilising the banking system while managing rampant real inflation and dwindling reserves‚Äîmake the situation even more complex. The cost of inaction or superficial measures could be disastrous, potentially leading to a prolonged economic depression that would inflict serious pain across the economy and the population, including consequential austerity measures that we want to minimise or avoid.

In times of financial crisis, events can spiral out quickly at lightning speed. Therefore, swift, timely action is vital once the objectives, trade-offs, and uncertainties are crystallised. A key realisation is that without substantial and necessary capital injection, the problems in the banking system cannot be resolved. When capital is eroded, financial engineering alone cannot remedy the situation‚Äîrestoring capital is the priority. Beyond the IMF bailout, Bangladesh should explore alternative funding options that may be unpopular, such as selling strategic assets to partners, issuing sovereign bonds, securitising real receivables (similar to municipal bonds and asset-backed securities), immediate and clear incentives for FDI, or a combination of these alternative approaches.



While controlling inflation is critical, it must be recognised that without timely access to sufficient financing options, there may be no choice but to resort to printing money. Once the constraints, trade-offs, and limitations are accepted, the decision-making process becomes clearer, allowing for more informed choices and consequences about the difficult path ahead. The plan must survive despite the pieces that are broken that we want to fix or compromise.

All policy decisions have consequences and must be thoroughly analysed and properly understood to minimise adverse material surprises. In this way, we can pick ourselves up and live to fight another day.

 An open letter to Chief Advisor Dr Yunus ,"
                        
                        
                        Dear honourable chief advisor,

You have stepped forward to take the helm of the government at a very critical time in our history. R

Regardless of how one might view our arrival, your courage indeed deserves high applause! Even more promising and deserving of applause was your commitment to embracing the country as one ‚Äòfamily‚Äô and striving to fix the fissures and fractures in the governing processes.

As an academic myself, I saw in your words the true manifestations of the spirit of our academic community, our commonly held faith in ourselves as selfless scholars in pursuit of truth and the common good, free of the contamination of narrow political interests or alignments.


The country needs reforms, but with your background in economics you know quite well that building institutions to serve as the guard rails of nationhood in all its dynamism is not a one-day affair, nor can we build institutions through rewriting the constitution or by constructing committees and councils. The British democracy, enduring as it has been, does not stand strapped to a written constitution!

The walls and pillars of nationhood are best constructed by monumental examples of fairness, transparency and disbursement of justice with inviolable guarantees of human rights. We, as a nation, need to build ‚Äúliving national memories‚Äù of the ideals we cherish. And, honourable chief advisor, you stand at a point in time that calls for you to set such examples that will forever become a beacon to beam light for us in our forward journey.

Your clarion call for the nation to unite as a family was most timely. We hope that you will indeed work towards that now that you are in the position to put in motion our drift towards unity. But before you can delve deep into this territory, an important question to ask is why did we get so fragmented in the first place?



The first realisation that comes to mind is the disrespectful fragmentation of our history of liberation: the motivated practice of selective and redacted reading of our history after the brutal assassination of the father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, has become a cause of the ever-widening chasm in the mantle of our nationhood. This needs to stop; there cannot be and should not be any abuse of our integral history for narrow political constituency-mongering.

There cannot be two readings of our history; it is a saga of a long and bloody struggle to realise our equitable rights and dignity as a people and eventually our independence as a sovereign nation among the nations of the world; it is a tale of tears and tribulations that stretches across decades, starting with the language movement.

Bangabandhu‚Äôs political career, that twice grazed death, is our long march to independence, and Gen Ziaur Rahman‚Äôs announcement over the radio on his behalf was the call of a son of the soil that galvanised us to rise as an army of freedom fighters ready to lay down our lives for independence. No party owns them individually and no party should build its brand on singular ownership of one of them while excluding the other. Honourable chief advisor, there needs to be a commission that includes scholars and members of civil society to settle this for all time.

The second important step is to set an example of unity-thinking. Right now, the Awami League seems to be cornered and its members are in hiding for fear of arrest. Ironically, on the other hand, Jama‚Äôat affiliates are coming out of the closet and freely expressing their thoughts and ideas. By no means does this have any semblance of a nation marching in unity as a family. Honourable chief advisor, we need to take steps that unambiguously give proof of our commitment to national unity, and not leave out Awami League and its allies. 

 

In that spirit, we need to rethink the constitution of the interim government. This interim government, with its claim of being a page-turner in our national history, needs to bear the hallmarks of a unity government by its documentable inclusivity. We need this if all the planned reforms are to receive the life force of an enduring code of governance. In my humble opinion, you should invite all political parties that have had parliamentary representation at some point in time, the leaders of civil society and professional classes to constitute a super advisory council to serve as the equivalent of a legislative entity. Let this body have the final say in approving reforms by absolute majority. This would effectively give the reforms the force of law.

The third step, but by no means any less important than the first two, is about the transparency and integrity of the judicial process, an equitable legal system homogeneous in its deployment.

Right now, the indiscriminate hounding and incarceration of Awami League affiliates even before the indictments have been formalised or preliminary investigations completed, is unmistakably, and I will say indelibly, undermining the standing of the interim government as an honest and unbiased arbiter of justice.

Further, taking into account the recent appointment of attorney Tajul Islam, a defence lawyer for Jama‚Äôat leaders charged with war crimes, as the prosecutor general of the International Crimes Tribunal, it all begins to add up to ‚ÄúOperation Pay Back Time‚Äù. At least so it would seem to any external non-Bangladeshi observer of these events.

It seems as if the majority of pro-liberation political party members have gone into hiding and their usual opponents are out in the open marching with pride and an unmistakable sense of impunity. The protection of law, freedom and right of expression should be equally accessible to all; so, why this stark lopsidedness? This was not among the constructive changes we had aspired for!

Honourable chief advisor, you wouldn‚Äôt want such a stain on your legacy, so please do not condone or endorse decisions that could be attributed to you as an act of vengeance. Yes, you had your differences with Sheikh Hasina that led to legal difficulties for you, but you are also an academic who won the Nobel Peace Prize. Can a Peace Prize winner stoop to such base instincts as exacting revenge? I am loath to believe that this can be a trait of your humble character.

Living abroad, I will say that both you, as our first Nobel Prize winner, and Hasina, for her remarkable strides in development, have made us proud. The falling out between the two of you has already caused much harm to the nation.

Even at the risk of sounding na√Øve, may I ask, ‚ÄúIs it possible for you two to patch up your differences and join hands to build this country as a sovereign and self-sufficient nation?‚Äù  

Hasina missed her chance for reconciliation. Perhaps you can succeed where she failed. The two of you together can make our country great in the league of nations.

You have been very successful in building an international network of well-wishers. It is time for you to do something similar within the country and not let pride get in the way. The country and the nation need a rapprochement between the two of you. Please do seriously consider this suggestion of mending your differences, even if it comes at some personal cost. This would be yet another example of unity-building that will inspire and guide generations after you‚Ä¶and possibly become your most enduring legacy in history. I earnestly appeal to you, even if it seems it is too late, to heal this fracture that divides the nation today!

Honourable chief advisor, you wouldn‚Äôt want such a stain on your legacy, so please do not condone or endorse decisions that could be attributed to you as an act of vengeance. Yes, you had your differences with Sheikh Hasina that led to legal difficulties for you, but you are also an academic who won the Nobel Peace Prize. Can a Peace Prize winner stoop to such base instincts as exacting revenge? I am loath to believe that this can be a trait of your humble character.

Living abroad, I will say that both you, as our first Nobel Prize winner, and Hasina, for her remarkable strides in development, have made us proud. The falling out between the two of you has already caused much harm to the nation.

Even at the risk of sounding na√Øve, may I ask, ‚ÄúIs it possible for you two to patch up your differences and join hands to build this country as a sovereign and self-sufficient nation?‚Äù  

Hasina missed her chance for reconciliation. Perhaps you can succeed where she failed. The two of you together can make our country great in the league of nations.

You have been very successful in building an international network of well-wishers. It is time for you to do something similar within the country and not let pride get in the way. The country and the nation need a rapprochement between the two of you. Please do seriously consider this suggestion of mending your differences, even if it comes at some personal cost. This would be yet another example of unity-building that will inspire and guide generations after you‚Ä¶and possibly become your most enduring legacy in history. I earnestly appeal to you, even if it seems it is too late, to heal this fracture that divides the nation today!

 Telecommunication transmission network demands massive thrust ,"
                        
                        
                        Imagine that you don‚Äôt have control over the way your heart pumps blood through your veins. Instead, someone else has been given the right to decide how the blood is to flow, what speed it is to travel and what routes it is to follow. Do you think your body can function to its full potential? Of course not!

But we are expecting the mobile operators to do this same impossible task when we have barred them from laying their own fibre-optic cable - the veins of the telecom network - and instead made an external party, the National Telecommunication Transmission Network, or NTTN, responsible for facilitating the smooth flow of data in their networks back in 2009.

Afterwards, we were not only barred from laying fibre on our own, but the NTTN operators decided to stop leasing us the dark core fibre in the cable they laid, instead, offering us only bandwidth, which was not cost-effective for us in any way. In fact, without dark fibre, we can‚Äôt design a robust fibre backbone. As the last straw on the camel‚Äôs back, we were not even allowed to purchase DWDM, an equipment that can optimise the use of the available and leased fibre. Such self-defeating measures only serve the interest of the NTTN operators.

In case you are struggling to follow the tech part of the logic, let‚Äôs try to understand why the fibre network is so important for telecommunication. When we use the voice and/or data service, our mobile phones send and receive signals from nearby mobile towers using wireless technology. Then the towers instantaneously send those signals back to the mobile operator‚Äôs core network to facilitate the service experienced by the end-user. This part of the network infrastructure is termed the transmission network.

The transmission network is considered the backbone of the mobile network since it is responsible for carrying data between the base stations, switching centres and the core network. Without a robust transmission network made up of high-quality fibre optic cables, we will never be able to deliver the optimum level of quality of service. The reason is very simple - wireless connections can carry data over a limited distance only, but fibre optic cables can carry virtually unlimited data for tens of kilometres without distortions and the need for boosting the signals.

Consider the amount of fibre optic cable that has been rolled out in Bangladesh and its quality. According to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, or BTRC‚Äôs June 2023 annual report, Bangladesh has 80,600 km of overhead (approximately) and 72,800 km of underground fibre optic cable. It‚Äôs worth noting that the overhead fibre optic cables do not meet the quality requirements for providing 4G service, let alone the upcoming 5G service. In other words, 53 percent of the country‚Äôs available fibre optic cables are unsuitable for providing quality data service in 4G technology.

So, in 15 years, the country has created an extremely weak transmission network with almost half of it unsuitable for the technological demands of the telecom sector. Contrast that with India, you will find that only in the nine months leading up to June 2023, they rolled out 913,950 km. In total, optical fibre rolled out as of June 2023 was a mammoth- 3,726,577 km in India.

Mobile operators in India had a huge role in this astounding level of fibre roll-out. We also see similar patterns in Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Whereas, in our own global benchmarking study, we have yet to find any country other than Bangladesh where the mobile operators are barred from laying their own fibre network.

The real irony is that while we have a severe deficit in fibre roll-out, the mobile operators don‚Äôt have access to all the available fibre in the country. Under the government-funded Info Sarkar project-3, more than 19,500 km of fibre (up to union level) was rolled out at a cost of Tk 21.41 billion. While the mobile operators struggle to get access to fibre network, this vast underutilised national resource remains out of reach for the operators since there is no modality in place to allow them access to this crucial infrastructure.

It is very clear from the empirical evidence illustrated earlier that our NTTN operators had invested in rolling out fibre optic cables from a short-term profit-centric objective. What we needed was a futuristic smart investment approach that readies the country to take the digital leap it deserves. Since that wasn‚Äôt to be, we are stuck with a rickety transmission network that is unfit for today‚Äôs telecommunication demands, let alone being able to facilitate the kind of digitisation the country so badly needs now.

What we need is to open up the transmission network market to the mobile operators along with anyone who has the credentials and the ability to invest and deliver what we need. The more competition we can create in this segment, the better served the nation and our customers will be, as it will help us to bring down the cost of data services for our customers and create a strong transmission network that can shoulder the aspirations of Bangladesh 2.0.

 Bangladesh‚Äôs flood response turns crisis into cooperation ,"
                        
                        
                        Bangladesh has shown how its 'engineering diplomacy' approach to managing a flood crisis could be a pathway to resilience.

Bangladesh faced a formidable double challenge in August.

A historic uprising unseated a long-standing prime minister, and just as the new interim government took charge, floods devastated the nation, leaving millions in despair. These events aren't just a national concern - they carry lessons that resonate globally.


RELENTLESS RAIN


August's floods were unprecedented in their scale and impact. They were the result of a complex interplay of several climatic phenomena - intensified monsoon rains, the Madden-Julian Oscillation and an unusual jet stream pattern - that led to unprecedented rainfall across South Asia. The city of Feni received 312mm of rain in one day.

Unlike previous major floods caused by the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers, this year's deluge was driven by smaller rivers in the southeast and northeast, with brutal force. The floods started early and developed fast, catching many off-guard.

Tropical Storm Remal affected southern Bangladesh and eastern India in late May, prompting widespread floods.

Then, mid-June brought relentless rains that submerged large regions, causing severe flooding in Sylhet, Feni and Cumilla.

On Aug 17 and 18, a monsoon low-pressure system developed over the Bay of Bengal and adjacent coastal areas.

This system remained there for two days, dumping huge rainfalls on the coast and the hilly regions of southeastern Bangladesh.


RISING RIVERS


River levels rose. On Aug 19, this low-pressure system intensified into a depression. Initially, the forecast suggested that this system would move toward Bihar through West Bengal, India.

However, it suddenly entered Bangladesh and remained over the central part of the country until Aug 20.

The situation took a dramatic turn as Feni recorded an unprecedented 312mm of rain in a single day on Aug 21.

A significant amount of rain also fell over river basins spanning India and Bangladesh. This deluge caused several rivers in the region to swell beyond danger levels.

In some areas, the rainfall was two to three times higher than usual, which overwhelmed the river systems and led to widespread inundation.


TIDAL SURGE


While extreme rainfall has been the primary catalyst for these floods, there is also speculation that the release of excess water from dams and barrages in India may have contributed.

In addition to the rainfall, the low-pressure system caused a higher-than-usual tidal surge.  Aug 19 was also a full moon, which further elevated the tidal surge.

This caused obstacles to the natural drainage of river water, leading to severe flooding. Much of this information was available in the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, maintained by the Bangladesh Water Development Board.

It appears that this information was not disseminated effectively to local agencies because of the chaos and confusion created after the fall of the government in early August.


CRISIS MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES


In times of disaster, emotions often run high, clouding the facts.

In Bangladesh, this was evident as public anger quickly turned toward India, with accusations upstream dam releases had worsened the flooding.


While such claims were difficult to substantiate, the sentiment was clear - mistrust between neighbours can exacerbate the impact of natural disasters.

This mistrust is not new. Since Bangladesh's independence in 1971, the relationship between Bangladesh and India has been tense, much of it rooted in perceived economic and political dominance by New Delhi.

August's floods brought these issues to the fore, highlighting long-standing grievances over water sharing, trade imbalances and employment dynamics.

But beyond the finger-pointing lies a deeper truth: global challenges such as climate change and natural disasters cannot be effectively managed without cooperation.

This is where the notion of engineering diplomacy - the integration of technical expertise with diplomatic efforts - becomes crucial.

Engineering diplomacy is not just about building infrastructure; it's about building trust and fostering cooperation. It's a principled, pragmatic approach that combines the problem-solving rigour of engineering with the nuanced negotiations of diplomacy.


OPPORTUNITIES FROM CRISIS


For Bangladesh, this year's flood provided two opportunities to turn crisis into cooperation building on the notion of engineering diplomacy.

First, the swift and effective response by student-led groups demonstrated the power of community-driven initiatives. These efforts not only provided immediate relief but also reinforced the importance of local engagement in building resilience.

Second, it means engaging India and other neighbours in developing shared solutions that are technically sound, socially acceptable, ethically responsible and politically feasible.

Consider the recent proposal by Bangladesh's interim government to establish a high-level mechanism with India for joint disaster management.

This initiative, rooted in the principles of engineering diplomacy, is a significant step toward building regional resilience.

By working together on flood forecasting, emergency response and resource management, Bangladesh and India can not only mitigate the impacts of future disasters but also build a foundation for greater cooperation on other shared challenges.


LESSONS FOR THE WORLD


The 2024 floods in Bangladesh offer critical lessons for the global community.

First, they underscore the urgent need for robust, cooperative mechanisms to address the increasingly frequent and severe impacts of climate change.

The science is clear: no country can tackle these challenges alone. International collaboration, grounded in mutual trust and shared responsibility, is essential.

Second, the floods highlight the importance of integrating local knowledge and grassroots action into disaster management strategies.

Finally, Bangladesh's experience underscores the need for a new narrative in global diplomacy - one that moves beyond blame and toward joint problem-solving.

The tensions between Bangladesh and India are not unique; similar dynamics play out in regions around the world where shared resources and geopolitical interests intersect.

Engineering diplomacy offers a framework for navigating these complexities, turning potential conflicts into opportunities for cooperation.

As the world confronts the escalating threats of climate change, the lessons from Bangladesh's 2024 floods are clear.

We must embrace a new approach -one that blends technical expertise with diplomatic finesse to build a more resilient, cooperative global community.

Engineering diplomacy provides a path forward, not just for managing disasters but for crafting a future where nations work together to tackle shared challenges.

 An open letter to the student leaders in the interim government ,"
                        
                        
                        Dear student leaders in the interim government, Bangladesh today stands at a new juncture, metaphorically, at the head of a fork. There are two roads that lead us forward into the misty horizon of history. The wherefore and whence of our arrival here is for historians to decide.

What is instructive for all of us to remember, is epitomised in the famous lines from Robert Frost‚Ä¶

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I‚Äî
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

Can we take the path ‚Äúless trodden by‚Äù to make the difference that we really seek to make? Can you truly carry out your role as the flag bearers of meritocracy, justice and democracy to symbolise this turning point as a monumental milestone in the history of the nation---a point that would truly mark our emergence into an era of true democracy, transparency and rule of law?


Let me humbly point out to you and your mentors or advisors a few instances where you, knowingly or unknowingly, seem to be deviating from the untrodden path‚Ä¶and onto the oft-trodden path‚Ä¶the path you decried against!


We have been at such forks before, and each time we circuited back to the fork yet again. So, what really happened? In simple terms, we invariably deviated from the very principles which had ushered us to the fork and got distracted by narrow political constituency-building. Now, your campaign was essentially against the quota system, which translates to a campaign for meritocracy in the hiring of government employees and officials. The question that posterity will ask you and all those in the interim government: did you yourselves adhere to this principle? You must look deep into your hearts and answer this with total honesty and conscientiously.


Let me share with you the thoughts visiting the minds of many apolitical non-partisan patriots of this country like me. Many of us expected that you would form yourself into a pan students‚Äô body to serve as an Ombudsman-like entity, while pursuing your education. It was a surprise to see that some of you were inducted as ‚Äúadvisors‚Äù in the interim government. How can the ‚Äústalwarts of meritocracy‚Äù succumb to the temptation of an office when the campaign of meritocracy had advanced behind the blood-stained garments of students who had sacrificed their lives for this very idea?  By what measure of education and experience do you justify to yourself your fitness to lead the ministries of a government which is faced with singularly great challenges of our times? How do the principles of meritocracy tally with your accepting a role among the helmsmen of the destiny of the nation? You owe it to the nation and particularly to the students of the country to explain and vindicate your position on this question. 

Posterity, distanced by time will gauge you away from the heat of our current times; theirs will be an assessment far more objective than we are willing to embrace at this time. The unmerited personalising of the success of a students‚Äô movement will not be viewed kindly, especially in view of the lives lost. They might see your action of self-benefit without due process or requisite qualification as a selfish pursuit by design. Some might even see it as callous trampling over the blood of martyrs for personal gain. And let me warn you, there are parallels of student veniality that are likely to taint your legacy: during the Gen HM Ershad era at least one student leader was assigned a ministerial role and later an ambassadorial appointment, and there could have been other such appointments under the radar. Perhaps this comparison is not what you want to be pinned on you.

Undoubtedly your role has been pivotal indeed, and to continue in that role it might be best for you to form a National Council of Students for Democracy and Justice to perform the role of a non-partisan body to safeguard the rule of law, human rights and preservation of democracy; perhaps the Interim government can formalise a role for your voice to be heard. The council needs to be apolitical and free of outside political interference. Carving a personal role unwarranted by qualification or experience inevitably threatens to undermine the sanctity of the movement itself: would you want that to happen? It is neither good for your legacy nor good for the students‚Äô heritage, and certainly undesirable for the nation.


Similarly, your campaign, in its later evolution, asked for transparency, accountability and the rule of law. Let me then ask you: did you all give proof of strict adherence to these principles? There has been widespread vandalism, some destroying iconic structures of historical significance to us, and when you were asked to account for these, you deflected the question by referring to the past government and its fifteen years of autocratic rule: how does that reflect your readiness to be accountable? Deflecting responsibility to the other is a common practice in our political discourse and one of the shields of political corruption: how are you different from any other political party then?

Aug 15, 1975, is a dark day in our history, regardless of whatever political party to which one might belong. The brutal massacre of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family is a tragedy that will remain fresh in our memory as a day drenched in blood. Bangabandhu‚Äôs legacy is for all of us to own and protect, not just the Awami League; giving the Awami League a monopoly of ownership of his political ancestry is the doing of all political parties that resorted to tarnishing the image and memory of Bangabandhu as the best way of counteracting the appeal of Awami League---a most unpatriotic choice of a campaign strategy. If you were indeed campaigning with a patriotic spirit, and for justice, how did you let Aug 15 be passed by as nothing but a regular day, denuding it of the status of a ‚ÄúDay of National Mourning‚Äù, acquiescing to the interest of a few political parties: did you really uphold justice and our patriotic values by letting this happen under your watch? You cannot put the blame on the past government and walk away saying it is their doing. Student movements have played significant roles in the national history of this country, and always so as standard bearers of the sentinels of idealism and history; this would be the first time that a student campaign stood silent over an unpatriotic and divisive decision over a question that belongs deeply to our national history. It is time that we take steps towards taking collective ownership of all our national heroes and let all political parties compete based on their agenda for national development and growth, and not capitalise on their specific claim of ownership of any of our national heroes.

The third question is about the reversal of court verdicts and the removal of government leaders at the apex of important government bodies. If your campaign was about due process, then how is the nation still in the dark about the reversal of some critical court decisions and removal of appointees at the apex of government bodies? However allegedly wrongful or questionable a court decision, it is always coded as a ruling by reference to articles of the constitution; similarly, a reversal of the ruling needs to follow due process and the ruling in reversal needs to be encoded defensibly by reference to articles of the constitution; to this date, the nation is in the dark about some reported and unreported reversal of court verdicts. There are rumours or news of convicted felons being released. The nation needs to know these as evidence of your commitment to oversee the preservation of transparency and adjudication of proper justice.

We cannot make light of the process of appointing and dismissing the leaders at the apex of government institutions. Just because we feel the past government was arbitrary in its appointment of these leaders, we cannot allow ourselves to act independently of the due process in dismissing these appointees---you marched under the banner of justice and transparency! So, what process was followed in the dishonourable dismissal of these top government officials? You need to publish an uncontroversial white paper that can be defended in a court of law. Short of that, it would appear that this government, under your idealistic watch, is pandering to the narrow political interests of some political parties or individuals, and you served as an accessory to the blatant pursuit of political vengeance.

Dear students, there are few countries in the world with a history where students played significant roles in its evolution as a nation as the students of Bangladesh. You have a rich legacy of patriotism and idealism to uphold and extend. It is our hope that you would be mindful of it and would not sully this rich legacy by stooping to narrow political interests. Please do not succumb to the temptations of forming yourself into a political party while in government; in that you will equate yourself with the questionable legacies of some political parties that emerged in the shadow of coups d‚Äôetat while the incumbent was still in the seat of power‚Äîby doing so, you will most likely earn the label of a front for a power base that is still in the shadows, and the change will be looked at as a coup d‚Äôetat, and not a people‚Äôs revolution as you aspire for it to be known.

History is a silent watcher of times; it may be quiet but it never ceases to record each of our actions and form its irrevocable judgement; in time its judgements will coalesce into forces that will unfailingly smoothen the kinks in the trajectory of our history. It is good to remember that we might tiptoe past a seemingly slumbering history for now, but it will be roused at some point in time, and when roused it will be unforgiving and ruthless in uprooting the errant transgressor. And the posterity will be no less unforgiving!

" Bangladesh 2.0 ‚Äì A path for principled, pragmatic governance ","
                        
                        
                        Imagine a new way of governing Bangladesh where everyone‚Äôs voice is heard, and the government truly works for the people. The choice of Bangladesh 2.0 is intentional. This envisioned future builds on the past, present, culture, and heritage of the nation with a vision that is actionable, adaptive, fair, just, and inclusive. It is an evolving vision of change with continuity, much like how Gen Z often reboots and reconfigures earlier systems of social media outlets with newer versions that build on past experiences, but adapt to changing needs.

What Bangladesh 1.0 witnessed was seismic and unprecedented. The 2024 student-led uprising is perhaps the only movement anywhere in the world not led by a political party that toppled an existing regime. Political parties did not drive the movement but many provided moral and material support as it expanded and gained widespread public participation. This Gen-Z-led and organically grown uprising is distinctly different from recent youth movements in Egypt or Tunisia and even from the history of earlier student movements in Bangladesh. All these movements were part of, and led by, political parties. More importantly, after the regime's fall, students played a significant and instrumental role in shaping the transition to Bangladesh 2.0. Now is the opportune time to be bold, creative, and visionary.

‚ÄúWe, the people of Bangladesh, hold autonomy, inclusivity, accountability, and the pursuit of justice as the foundational principles to guide the formation and functioning of the government to serve all citizens of our nation.‚Äù

As we engage in imagining and creating Bangladesh 2.0, we must acknowledge the complexity of nation-building (Stephenson, 2005) and the fallibility of the human race ‚Äì irrespective of geography, culture, religion, and time ‚Äì and be principled in our ideals and pragmatic in their implementation.

THE IDEA OF JUSTICE

As we begin our conversation to create a just, fair, and equitable Bangladesh, rather than aiming for a utopian perfectly just society, it is more realistic to focus on how we can reduce injustice in the world we live in. Let us start by distinguishing between ‚Äònyaya‚Äô (ideal justice) and ‚Äòniti‚Äô (institutional justice). While ‚Äònyaya‚Äô refers to the guiding principles, ‚Äòniti‚Äô focuses on the rules, regulations, institutions, and lived experiences of people. A just system needs to prioritise ‚Äònyaya‚Äô‚Äîthe reduction of injustice in people‚Äôs lives as a guiding principle‚Äîwhile ‚Äòniti‚Äô operationalizes ‚Äònyaya‚Äô through rules and regulations within the judicial system. The proposed Bangladesh 2.0 governance system will be rooted in practical reasoning and the realities of human life. It will uphold the principles of autonomy, equity, access to opportunity, accountability, and responsibility. This idea of justice is a synthesis of ‚Äònyaya‚Äô and ‚Äòniti‚Äô.

By shifting the focus from ideal theories of governance to pragmatic solutions that matter, we can create a more flexible and realistic system, one that is attuned to the complexities and diversities of human values. Building on Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen‚Äôs ‚Äòcapability approach,‚Äô (Wells) the proposed system focuses on what individuals can do and be‚Äîwith their capabilities and constraints‚Äîrather than just the resources or rights they possess. This notion of justice involves expanding people‚Äôs capabilities to live the lives they value. It can guide action to reduce injustice by enhancing human capabilities, engaging in public reasoning, and addressing the plurality of human values to create a path toward achieving a more just Bangladesh.

AN ACTIONABLE IDEA

Emphasising the importance of capabilities and constraints, public reasoning, and nyaya-niti-based justice, we begin with one consequential idea for action. Framing and formulation of this idea begins with a national conversation to create Bangladesh 2.0. Given the deep level of mistrust in the existing system of governance, institutional malaise, and the nature of the interim government, let us begin by envisioning the Bangladesh 2.0 Governance System. The first component of this governance system is the Electoral Reform Ordinance. Admittedly, the scope and structure of this ordinance need to be discussed with legal experts for its initial implementation and constitutional ratification after the election. It is useful to think of this discourse as the beginning of a national conversation to create the basis for Bangladesh 2.0.

KEY FEATURES OF THE ELECTORAL REFORM ORDINANCE

The Electoral Reform Ordinance will synthesise fair representation at the national and local levels, ensuring that everyone, no matter where they live or who they are, has a say in how the election is conducted and the governance system is implemented. More importantly, it will include specific input from students as a watchdog group. Such active engagement of students in the governance of a country is distinctively unique and has the potential to become a global model.

First, everyone will have two votes in an election: (a) Vote 1 is for a local representative (Member of Parliament, MP) who knows and understands the needs of your community; and (b) Vote 2 is for a political party that you think should have more power at the national level. This way, as an active citizen, you can elect someone who knows the pulse of the community and can actively advocate for its betterment, while the overall government (Jatiya Sangsad, National Parliament) reflects the preferences of people across the country. The executive branch would be led by a prime minister, elected by the Jatiya Sangsad, who would be the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats.

Second, the proposed system will include provisions for students to have a significant role in national-level decision-making. The proposed ""Shadhin Chattra Pareeshad"" will be a student-led group that will: (a) monitor the government's activities to ensure they are acting fairly and transparently; (b) provide feedback and hold the government accountable; and (c) ensure that this group remains independent of political parties but in close contact with different branches of the government to ensure pragmatic pursuit and implementation of different components of Bangladesh 2.0. Students from all universities will elect representatives every year, who will then form the core of this watchdog group following some variants of the Spokescouncil process (Seeds for Change) that enable consensus building with hundreds and thousands of people. They will act as the ""people‚Äôs ombudsmen,"" (Wikipedia) ensuring that Bangladesh‚Äôs government remains just and transparent.

Third, to ensure that everyone is included, especially those who have been left out in the past (like women, minorities, and indigenous people), there will be special seats reserved for them. These seats will be allocated based on the percentage of votes they receive, ensuring that these groups have a voice in the government.



Fourth, local government bodies (e.g., Upazila Parishads, Union Parishads) would be given greater autonomy and resources to manage local affairs. Local elections would be held using a simple majority system, with strong mechanisms for transparency and accountability, ensuring that local representatives are directly accountable to their communities. A portion of national revenues would be allocated directly to local governments, with mechanisms for citizen participation in budget planning and monitoring. In Indonesia, decentralisation reforms have given more autonomy and resources to local governments, enabling them to manage education, health, and infrastructure more effectively. Brazil‚Äôs participatory budgeting process allows citizens to have a direct say in how local government budgets are allocated, leading to more transparent and inclusive decision-making.

Fifth, two-term limits will be mandated for all elected officials, including the Prime Minister, MPs, and others. This ensures that fresh voices and perspectives regularly enter the parliament and other decision-making bodies, prevents the concentration of power in one individual, and encourages the development of new leaders.

A PROCESS TO FORMULATE THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE

This is an evolving proposal to begin a national conversation to formulate an ordinance that will eventually be integrated into the Constitution after the election. Such an ordinance will provide the legal framework to hold a national election and facilitate the transfer of power from the interim government to an elected parliament. An Ordinance Formulation Council will be formed, consisting of members from the legal community, business community, student community, non-governmental organizations, and other relevant stakeholders. Over the next three months, a series of stakeholder engagement sessions will be organised by the Ordinance Formulation Council at the district level to solicit input and feedback to refine and revise this proposed ordinance. An International Facilitator Committee will be appointed to oversee the formulation of this ordinance as a consensus-based guiding document. Once the ordinance is finalised, an election date will be announced.

The proposed electoral reform ordinance is the first principled pragmatic step toward creating a fairer, more inclusive, and more accountable government in Bangladesh. By combining local empowerment with national fairness and engaging the student group as a watchdog, this system can help build a stronger and more united country where every citizen has a say in how the nation is run. Subsequent steps will include reform of the judicial system, economic system, and administrative system.

 Key reforms needed in public universities now ,"
                        
                        
                        Since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government on Aug 5, a myriad of challenges have emerged that need to be addressed by the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus.

Every crisis offers new opportunities, and the new government must now demonstrate a clear strategy for reform to reassure the public.

The newly formed government is a historic first for Bangladesh, characterised by a meritocratic composition that includes renowned Dhaka University professors, bankers, NGO activists, lawyers, former military officers, and emerging leaders.

A recurring theme in their recent statements suggests that all interim advisors are strongly advocating for changes and reforms.

Every sector will be dealt with differently, so I had better limit my scope towards reform in higher education (public universities) today, especially highlighting the immediate reforms we need to envisage.

Firstly, the recent quota reform movement, which led to a change in leadership, has strained the teacher-student relationship to its lowest point. It is imperative to underscore this dynamic because the entire system is built on this provision. Students have alleged that teachers in most public universities failed to support and protect them as their shield.

Rebuilding this once-revered relationship will take time, but teachers must first restore the bond based on mutual trust and shared commitments.

Reflecting on the teachers' movements in 2015 regarding salaries and in 2024 regarding the pension scheme, it is clear that students did not rally for the teachers, even when the 2024 movement was solely for aspiring teachers, not those currently teaching.

This depleted trust has to be restored, and there is no shame in acknowledging that the teachers failed to stand beside their students. Initiating open dialogues between students and teachers is a good starting point for fostering positive change, even if it happens slowly.

Secondly, the government should abstain from inaugurating new universities driven by political stimulants.

The current convention of setting up universities on a district basis has largely affected higher education.

Rather than following this approach, endeavours should be directed towards enhancing the existing universities and elevating them to the status of centres of excellence. It is a well-known fact that the universities lack funding. So, instead of opening new universities, the state should financially empower those existing universities.

Instead of hastily introducing undergraduate programmes immediately after the passage of a university Act, without ensuring adequate physical infrastructure, a more prudent approach would be to provide a grace period for new universities to establish their facilities and academic curriculum. Once these are in place, the universities can proceed with advertising for student admissions.

Thirdly, many universities currently operate without vice-chancellors (VCs), who serve as the de facto chief executives.

Traditionally, only academics close to the government have been appointed to these positions, despite the presence of highly accomplished vice-chancellors with significant academic achievements. It is imperative for the government to prioritise performance over political associations when selecting VCs.

In the words of esteemed political scientist Abdur Razzak, as cited in Ahmed Safa‚Äôs noted book, 'Joddopi Amar Guru', VCs should retain a combination of qualities: strong administrative skills and academic excellence.

To reform the process of appointing VCs in universities, it is suggested that the government establish search committees comprising distinguished academics from both home and abroad.

These committees would propose multiple candidates, and the Senate (for universities operating under the 1973 ordinance) and the government (for universities governed by government Acts) would make the final appointment of a VC.

VCs could serve for a single tenure of four years to ensure a psychological change that the chair is not a personal position. Before appointing VCs for an entire tenure, the government could make temporary appointments for a three to six-month period, ensuring that all appointments are time-specific.

On a related note, appointments to top positions like VCs or pro-VCs often happen without public transparency. Given the nature of these roles as tenured positions, universities should issue open job circulars to invite qualified candidates.

This proactive step would reduce the need for teachers to regularly communicate with the ministry by informal channels.

It's quite comical that faculty members have been asked to submit their resumes to the ministry, considering that their academic information is already available online.

It should be a prerequisite for any prospective vice chancellor to have their academic information readily accessible online.

Criteria for appointing a VC should be his 'vision strategy', which s/he will submit through a detailed application and a closed-door talk that includes committee members, the senate, invited faculties, and representative students from every department.

On top of that, any academic having formal affiliation with any political party should be barred from applying for the position.

It is paramount for university leaders, such as VCs, to exhibit the ability to engage with their colleagues and students.

It's important for them to recognise that they are not traditional bosses in the context of a university.

In addition, it's beneficial to consider the criteria of being supportive of both students and teachers.

To drive positive change in academia, it is essential for all universities to appoint VCs who are empathetic and prioritise administrative reform.

This emphasis on administrative reform is foremost, as without it, consequential change within academia in research and teaching will be significantly hindered.

Fourthly, in my decade-long experience of teaching at Dhaka University, I have observed that students struggle every day at the university which begins with an accommodation crisis.

Identifying the causes and implementing interventions could minimise the collective agony that students experience at the university.

For example, a student from a village may seek shelter with political leaders for a place in residential halls, which can ultimately demoralise their academic abilities and lead to underperformance at the university.

Therefore, admission to the universities should be proportionate to the accommodation facilities available.

First-year undergraduate students should be guaranteed accommodation if they need it, as it should be a priority.

The universities should immediately raise funds for constructing new residences or rent buildings to make student accommodation. I can guarantee that with having better accommodation, students will perform much better with ease.

One possible funding for constructing a new residence could be a public-private partnership where the university will allow private donors to construct a residence and the hall could be named after according to the wish of the donors.

Accepting donations towards new residences will reduce the crisis to a great extent. It is quite evident that after the recent change in government, there has been a noticeable shift in hall allotments, indicating a departure from the age-old tradition of allowing ex-students to reside in the halls.

Fifthly, in my experience, one key factor contributing to debilitated teacher-student relationships is the inclusion of house tutors in university residences.

Given that house tutors do not have academic responsibilities in the halls now, I believe that we no longer need them. Instead, having a provost, an assistant provost, and other administrative staff should suffice to manage the residence halls.

Since the halls are not academic spaces, there is no need for teachers to be present.

Unlike at Oxford University, where house tutors have academic roles, we should move away from this outdated approach.

Finally, in light of the current turbulent times, it is essential to address the structural soft aspects of our universities, focusing on research and teaching, which I will discuss in the upcoming episode including issues such as teaching and research facilities and global ranking.

I will also share my teaching experience at the University of Leeds in the next episode which I believe will be instrumental towards the positive changes.

It is imperative to devise a strategic plan that encompasses short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives.

We should work towards rebuilding not only Dhaka University and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, or BUET, but all universities in the country.

This strategic reform will undoubtedly lead to positive changes for the country by building our universities as ‚Äòinstitutions‚Äô. Let us get united for a common cause-rebuild the country.

 China‚Äôs big ball of money has nowhere else to go ,"
                        
                        
                        China's investors are bumping up against the country's strict capital controls. Warnings from Beijing have managed to slow a rush into government bonds in recent months that was sparked by a lack of better options for parking cash. That has left a big ball of money with nowhere else to go.

Previously, when property prices sagged, households would buy stocks; when shares sold off, people would pile into real estate; when both looked shaky, more money would end up in bank accounts.

This year, lenders are offering low savings rates, stocks are moribund, and house prices are still falling. That has made Chinese government bonds an obvious refuge. But the pace of the pile-in has had some astounding consequences. In May, the price of a new debt issue spiked 25 percent. Two months later the People's Bank of China surprised with a rate cut, which fuelled another rally that threatened to push yields further below those of US Treasuries. And in recent weeks the central bank strongly suggested lenders cool their ""speculative"" bond-buying jets.

Such warnings have had some success, with Chinese treasury futures selling off in recent weeks. Banks aren't the only buyers, though. Investment funds accounted for 53 percent of bond purchases in the first seven months of the year, Standard Chartered estimates. Some of that demand may have come from households spurning lacklustre deposit rates, as Goldman Sachs estimates cumulative excess savings in China fell about 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) in the second quarter, to 3.1 trillion yuan.

Letting Chinese financial institutions offer more investment products tied to overseas markets ought to be a logical next step. The demand is there: domestic lenders have been scrambling to increase their Beijing-mandated quota limits, Reuters reported this month.

This would have several beneficial effects, especially if as expected the US Federal Reserve starts cutting rates: that would soften the dollar, making overseas investments even more appealing. Returns would probably be higher, which would help households better cope with the economic slowdown. And letting more money go abroad would help ward off excess appreciation of the renminbi.

When the economy does finally turn the corner, returns from investment abroad could be ploughed back into domestic markets. Chances are, though, that Beijing will not want to lift the restrictions enough to make a difference. That means the big ball of cash will, despite official opprobrium, soon find its way back into the domestic bond market, putting the central bank back on the defensive.

 An Interesting Parallel ,"
                        
                        
                        There is an interesting parallel, in regard to the role of the Mujib family, between the taking-up of the role of Prime Minister on Jan 12, 1972, and the resignation from the role of prime minister on Aug 5, 2024. As is well known, it was her family who persuaded Sheikh Hasina Wazed to resign on Aug 5, against her own wish to stay on as prime minister.

After the liberation in December 1971 of Dhaka, officials from the inner core of the government were quartered in the former governor's house (which was to be named Bangabhaban). These officials included my father Ambassador AFM Abul Fateh, who had been Adviser to the Acting President since late August 1971 and foreign secretary from the end of October 1971. On Jan 10, 1972, the president, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, arrived in Dhaka to take up his responsibilities, after his release from imprisonment in Pakistan. He too was quartered in Bangabhaban.

The next day, Jan 11, 1972, my father was with Sheikh Mujib when the vice-president (and former acting president) Nazrul Islam and Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmed walked into the room. There were just the four of them present when Nazrul Islam said that he and Tajuddin had been discussing the future, and that they considered that Tajuddin should continue to run the country as Prime Minister, while Mujib would remain as a constitutional President, and as President and leader to independence he would be the person to whom everyone could look up to as being above politics. (I do not remember whether my father, whose words a few years later to me form the basis of this article, said that the role of the Queen in the United Kingdom was mentioned, but it would have been natural. My father certainly was of the view that Mujib was an inspiring leader, able to move a whole nation, rather than an administrator. But I do not know how much my father spoke that day.)

Mujib thought this was an excellent idea.

The following morning, Mujib called in Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin and my father. Mujib said that he had spoken to his family. His family had said that he must run the country. So he must become the Prime Minister.

What happened next is well known. The most senior judge of the country was Justice Abu Sayeed Chowdhury. He was called into Bangabhaban that day, and informed that he was becoming President in succession to Mujib. My father told me that he saw Abu Sayeed Chowdhury walking out of Bangabhaban like a zombie, a stunned expression on his face.

My father also told me that at this point he decided that things would not go well. He arranged for himself to return to serving abroad as an Ambassador, though Mujib had wanted him to be Foreign Minister.

As I said, it is an interesting parallel. In January 1972 Mujib was persuaded by his family to take up power as Prime Minister. And in August 2024, his daughter was persuaded by her family to relinquish power as Prime Minister.

 Ukraine battles its demography to find sufficient soldiers: Peter Apps ,"
                        
                        
                        In April the intelligence wing of Ukraine‚Äôs defence ministry noted a trend emerging on Ukrainian social media platforms - videos apparently filmed overseas of Ukrainian men holidaying on beaches, enthusiastically telling each other how they had gone abroad to avoid being drafted into the military to fight.

Ukrainian officials swiftly concluded that the videos - disseminated primarily on the social media platform TikTok - were part of a mounting Russian campaign to undercut Ukrainian military recruitment.

As well as the holiday videos celebrating the freedom of ‚Äúevaders‚Äù, the officials said they noted an uptick in newly written ‚Äúfolksongs‚Äù celebrating avoidance of military service, as well as videos in which Ukrainian women encouraged men to avoid being pulled into the military.

Almost two-and-a-half years into Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the battle for sufficient human resources to keep on fighting is now as important to both Moscow and Kyiv as the competition for physical supplies of weaponry.

In both nations, the prospect of conscripting ever-larger numbers of personnel is politically hugely contentious, particularly as the conflict shows no signs of ending.

In April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a decree lowering the conscription age from 27 to 25.

Whereas other countries fighting existential wars have usually fallen back on recruiting vast numbers of young men as soon as they reach 18 years of age, Ukraine was already facing a demographic crisis before the war began, and remains desperate to shield its younger adults.

Russia faces not so dissimilar demographic problems - this war is the first in history between ageing states with declining populations.

But of the two, Ukraine‚Äôs demographics put it at a disadvantage. While Russia‚Äôs population was already predicted to shrink by 25 percent over the next two generations, Ukraine‚Äôs was set to fall by almost half.

Long-term studies of Ukraine‚Äôs population suggest its birth rate began to fall as long ago as the 1960s - well before much of the rest of what was then the Soviet Union.

But it plunged particularly fast after independence in the 1990s and the start of the new millennium, leaving a particular shortage of young people now in their late teens or early twenties.

The result is a war increasingly fought by older men, supplemented by handfuls of young male and female volunteers.

According to a US Congressional Research Service (CRS) report in June, the average Ukrainian frontline soldier is now 40 years of age, while those who watch the conflict closely say that even the growing numbers of increasingly vital drone operators are often in their thirties.

Even without those demographics, simple population numbers would disadvantage Ukraine ‚Äì its population of 38 million is only just over a third of Russia‚Äôs 144 million, giving the Kremlin an inevitably much larger pool of personnel to draw from.

At the start of the full-blown war in February 2022, Ukraine immediately banned all men aged between 18 and 60 from leaving the country. From July 16 this year, every man in that age group is required to have updated an online or in-person form detailing their location, fitness and other details.

How effective that program has been is not yet clear. Recent Ukrainian rounds of conscription have been messy and unpopular, with plenty of talk of corruption, faked medicals signed off by well-remunerated doctors, and some men fleeing the country or taking whatever steps they can to keep out of military service.

According to a recent report from US-funded Radio Free Europe, more than 30,000 Ukrainian men have crossed into Romania and Moldova alone since the invasion started in 2022.

Ukrainian officials have talked of encouraging European nations to forcibly return such individuals, but few countries have expressed any willingness to do so.

Even more striking are the numbers who appear to have applied for postgraduate university programmes in the hope of deferring or avoiding military service.

In the first six months of 2024, Ukraine‚Äôs Ministry of Education and Science reported an astounding 246,000 individuals applying for postgraduate or masters-level courses, compared to only 7,000-9,000 doing such courses before the war.

Of those applicants, at least 90,000 were fighting-age men, said Ukrainian officials, who added that they would tighten academic application rules.

RUSSIAN FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

Exactly how many service personnel Ukraine still needs is hard to tell - the Kyiv government is understandably cagey on numbers with its forces already spread along 1,200 miles (1,945 km) of front.

In December, Zelenskiy suggested the military might need 500,000 new personnel this year alone, although that number appears to have since been watered down.

Estimates of Russian recruitment and military ones are also similarly varied. What is clear, however, is that Kremlin-backed media have aggressively pushed the narrative that Ukraine is forcing unwilling citizens to fight, while Russia has been able to avoid the large compulsory draft many had expected by using financial incentives to hire volunteer contract soldiers.

Whether that is true is hard to say.

In March, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree calling on 150,000 military-aid personnel to serve as conscripts. In theory, conscripts remain exempt from being forced to fight in Ukraine, although there have been multiple cases throughout the war in which this pledge appears to have been broken.

According to Russian news agency TASS this week, volunteer Russian citizens and foreigners who signed a contract to serve in Ukraine for a year or more will each receive a one-off payment of 400,000 rubles (approximately $4,600), roughly twice what was offered in 2022.

Russian conscript soldiers receive a monthly allowance of around 210,000 rubles (approximately $2,500), almost three times Russia's average monthly wage.

In some Russian regions, local authorities have promised financial incentives for those who persuade friends to join the armed forces, while the Kremlin also appears to be stepping up recruitment from Russia's prison population through offering reduced or cancelled sentences.

Independently conducted opinion polls suggest such moves are much more popular than a forced draft, which up to 57 percent of the population say they would oppose.

Increasingly, however, most analysts believe Russia will turn again to significant draft conscript personnel within the coming year, whether to bolster forces in Ukraine or free up other troops to send there.

CHINA DEMOGRAPHICS

How Russia does choose to manage its military staffing will be closely watched in Europe, particularly those nervous nations along NATO‚Äôs eastern flank such as Poland, the three small Baltic republics, and Finland.

For now, most assume Russia will not have the available combat power to attack while it remains entrenched in Ukraine. But they worry that once that war concludes, Russia‚Äôs declining demographics may see it turn on one of NATO‚Äôs eastern members sooner rather than later.

Almost all the nations of eastern and central Europe have their own declining populations, as do US allies in Asia ‚Äì Japan and South Korea in particular.

Most Western nations are often in a similar position ‚Äì and as in Ukraine, face considerable issues recruiting sufficient personnel or retaining them within the military.

The most important demographics shaping future global war risk, however, may be those of China, whose now-abandoned ‚Äúone child‚Äù policy has it on the edge of its own demographic precipice.

According to estimates from the US Census Bureau, China in 2020 had almost 360 million males aged between 15 and 50 - but this will fall to under 300 million by 2040, less than three-quarters of that of nearby India.

Arguably even more important will be the financial drag of China‚Äôs ageing population ‚Äì the population aged over 65 will jump 150 percent from 2015 to 2040 to almost 340 million people.

US officials already say Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. Increasingly, they worry that China‚Äôs demographic pressures mean that those in charge in Beijing may feel that if they are going to risk a major war, they may need to do it soon.

 Arms race gathers pace as Russia and US plan to redeploy once-banned weapons ,"
                        
                        
                        Four decades ago, the United States deployed cruise and Pershing II nuclear missiles in Europe to counter Soviet SS-20s - a move that stoked Cold War tensions but led within years to a historic disarmament deal.

""We can be proud of planting this sapling, which may one day grow into a mighty tree of peace,"" Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev told US President Ronald Reagan in December 1987 as they agreed to dismantle the rival systems under a treaty that scrapped all ground-based shorter-range and intermediate-range (INF) nuclear and conventional weapons - those with ranges between 500 km and 5,500 km.

The sapling survived until 2019 when Donald Trump, then US president, quit the treaty, citing alleged violations that Russia denied. But the risky implications of the pact's full unravelling are becoming fully apparent only now, as both sides set out their plans for new deployments.

On June 28, President Vladimir Putin said publicly that Russia would resume producing short and intermediate-range land-based missiles - something the West suspects it was already doing anyway - and take decisions on where to place them if needed. Security experts assume these missiles, like most Russian systems, will be capable of carrying either conventional or nuclear warheads.

On July 10, the United States said it will start deployment in Germany from 2026 of weapons that will include SM-6s and Tomahawks, previously placed mainly on ships, and new hypersonic missiles. These are conventional systems but some could also, in theory, be fitted with nuclear tips, and security experts said Russian planning would have to allow for that possibility.

The decisions, taken against the background of acute tensions over Russia's war in Ukraine and what the West sees as threatening nuclear rhetoric from Putin, add to an already complex array of threats for both sides. They also form part of a wider INF arms race with China.

""The reality is that both Russia and the United States are taking steps that they believe enhance their security, regardless of whether it comes at the expense of the other,"" said Jon Wolfsthal, director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists.

""And as a result, every move that the United States or Russia make puts pressure on the adversary to respond in some way, politically or military. That's the definition of an arms race,"" Wolfsthal, a former US arms control official, said in a telephone interview.

STRIKE SCENARIOS

Andrey Baklitskiy, senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, said the planned deployments created ""more scenarios for direct military confrontation between Russia and NATO countries"" for which all sides needed to prepare.

Hypothetically, he said, these could include eventualities such as a Russian strike on a Polish base where Western weapons bound for Ukraine were being stored, or a US attack on a Russian radar or a command and control post.

He said each side already has the capability to carry out such strikes using sea- or air-launched missiles, but adding ground-based weapons would give them more options to conduct an attack and withstand the enemy's response.

The risk, the experts said, is that this fuels already-high tensions and prompts a further spiral of escalation.

Wolfsthal said he saw the planned US deployments in Germany as a signal of reassurance to European allies rather than a step conferring any significant military advantage.

""My only concern about the deployment of these systems is they may not really add to our military capability but they almost certainly add to the risk that a crisis could accelerate and grow out of control,"" he said.

Ulrich Kuehn, an arms control specialist at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy in Hamburg, said in a telephone interview: ""From a Russian perspective, if you deploy these kind of weapons in Europe, they can generate strategic (threat) effects - to Russian command centres, to political centres in Russia, to airfields, airstrips where Russian strategic bombers are placed.""

Russia might respond, he said, by deploying more strategic missiles that point at the continental United States.

HOW WOULD CHINA RESPOND?

Any deployment of Russian and US intermediate-range missiles could also prompt a further build-up by China, which was not bound by the 1987 Soviet-U.S. treaty and so has been free to ramp up its own INF arsenal.

The US Department of Defense said in a 2023 report to Congress that China's rocket force has 2,300 missiles with ranges between 300 km and 3,000 km, and a further 500 that can travel between 3,000 km and 5,500 km.

Concern about China's missiles was an important factor behind Trump's decision to quit the treaty with Russia, and the US has already taken an initial step towards placing its own intermediate-range weapons in allied countries in Asia. In April it made its first overseas deployment of previously banned ground-launched missiles when it took part in a two-week military exercise in the Philippines.

""This will not be a two-party arms race between Russia and the United States and its allies, it will be a much more complex one,"" Kuehn said, with potential to involve China and other US allies in Asia such as South Korea and Japan.

All three experts said the chances of Russia and the United States arriving at a breakthrough arms control deal of the kind that Reagan and Gorbachev struck in 1980s were remote.

""Even if Russia and the United States would totally agree that 'this whole thing is not helping anybody, let's get back to the INF treaty' or whatever, the US would not be able to do that because of China, because they really need those systems to match Chinese capabilities,"" Baklitskiy said.

The likelihood, he added, was that ""we will just continue piling up those systems and targeting them at each other. So it doesn't seem like we have a nice time ahead of us.""

 NATO‚Äôs Washington summit deepens alliance spat with China ,"
                        
                        
                        As NATO‚Äôs 75th anniversary summit kicked off in Washington this week, China‚Äôs defence ministry made a surprise announcement.

An unspecified number of elite Chinese paratroopers and other military forces, it said, were flying to Belarus to conduct previously unannounced joint training that would last throughout the NATO gathering.

The exercise, codenamed ""Eagle Assault‚Äù, will last 11 days until July 19, conducting ""anti-terrorist exercises"" including night landings, crossing water obstacles and urban operations.

More pointedly still, they will take place in the Belarusian city of Brest, five miles from the border with NATO member Poland - although Chinese officials denied the manoeuvres were aimed at any particular foreign country.

Even without the drills - which appear to be among the largest exercises China has ever conducted on the European continent - China was always set to be on the agenda at the NATO summit.

There was a formal meeting on Thursday morning of alliance leaders with Asia-Pacific ""partners"" from Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese did not attend the meeting, instead represented by his deputy.

China is an ever-rising concern to many within NATO and beyond, not least because of what US and other allied officials say is Beijing's increasing support for Russia in Ukraine, delivering a growing number of critical components for Russian weapons systems, if not yet lethal weaponry itself.

""We must not forget that today the PRC (People's Republic of China) is the largest enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through the provision of dual-use goods,"" NATO Director of Policy Planning Benedetta Berti told an event at think-tank The Atlantic Council on Monday.

China could not expect to be treated as a responsible member of the international community while doing that, she added.

After the leak of a draft of the NATO summit communiqu√© that used similar language, Chinese officials responded furiously.

""As we all know, China is not the creator of the crisis in Ukraine,"" a Chinese foreign affairs ministry spokesman said, describing the draft NATO declaration as ""full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric"" and the China-related content as ""full of provocations, lives, incitement and smears.‚Äù

What approach new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will take to China remains unclear ‚Äì but his predecessor was pulling few punches at his last international summit.

""If China continues (like this), they cannot have it both ways,"" outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told another public think-tank session.

""They cannot believe that they can have a kind of normal relationship with NATO allies in North America and Europe, and then continue to fuel the war in Europe that constitutes the biggest security challenge...since the Second World War.""

SOME DIVISIONS OVER ASIA STRATEGY

Exactly how NATO might engage itself in Asia is a subject of no little disagreement ‚Äì at last year‚Äôs conference in Vilnius, French President Emmanuel Macron vetoed an otherwise widely-backed proposal to open a small alliance office in Japan.

While supporters of that proposal say it is important to keep NATO directly involved in major global security issues including in the Pacific region, others ‚Äì most particularly France ‚Äì argue such activity risks being a distraction from NATO‚Äôs core task of defending Europe.

Hungary, whose nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited Beijing on Monday after an equally controversial trip to Moscow, said this week it was particularly opposed to NATO becoming what it called an ""anti-China bloc"".

This year, Chinese officials have become much more vocal in their opposition to NATO conducting any Asia-facing work.

""It is necessary to resist the negative impact of the Indo-Pacific strategy and guard against NATO reaching out to the Asia-Pacific,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Thai counterpart Maris Sangiampongsa on Tuesday.

An alliance that began with 12 members in 1949, and now includes 30 European nations plus the United States and Canada, NATO‚Äôs founding North Atlantic Treaty declares that an attack on one member is an attack on all.

That promise is explicitly limited to the North Atlantic region, although the alliance has already occasionally operated ‚Äúout of area‚Äù including during conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya.

Speaking in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lian Jian responded to a question on the NATO summit by saying China's stance on the alliance remained ""consistent"".

""We firmly oppose NATO acting beyond its characterisation as a regional defence alliance, inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region,"" he said.

In reality, few of the discussions in Washington this week revolve around NATO ‚Äúexpanding‚Äù to include Asia, certainly not through bringing in potential Asian members such as Japan, South Korea or the Philippines.

All of these countries have their own mutual defence deals with the US already, plus other, ever-deepening multinational relationships, all spurred by mounting worries over China.

Taiwan, recognised by most nations as part of China but functioning as a de facto independent state, has its relations with the US government under the US-Taiwan Relations Act, which has always left ‚Äústrategically ambiguous‚Äù whether Washington would defend the island, though President Joe Biden has more recently said several times emphatically that it would.

But NATO‚Äôs European members have plenty of other concerns about Beijing, including intellectual property theft and what they see as Chinese efforts to unfairly swamp their markets with cheap electric cars, batteries and other products.

'NEW LANDSCAPE', SAYS BLINKEN

At the end of January, the US military headquarters in Europe at Ramstein Air Base in Germany held a NATO conference explicitly aimed at stopping Chinese efforts to recruit former allied military pilots and other air crew to train Beijing's military as contractors.

US officials warned that some of those efforts included recruitment by front companies that did not declare their links to China‚Äôs military.

""Increasingly, partners in Europe see challenges...in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe is being relevant to them,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Brookings Institution think-tank last week.

Blinken said the US was working to break down barriers between allies in Europe, Asia and worldwide. ""That's part of the new landscape, the new geometry that we've put in place.""

For all that, however, there will have been no shortage of voices in Washington this week warning NATO‚Äôs European members that they cannot afford to get too sidetracked by thinking about Beijing.

Indeed, insiders say one of the purposes of the classified ‚ÄúNATO Secret‚Äù session with Asia-Pacific leaders was to convince the Europeans the risk of war in Asia is now very real ‚Äì and that with the US now increasingly focused on the China threat, Europe must do more to defend itself.

Such views may be voiced most loudly by those competing for places in a future Donald Trump administration, but they are shared by many within the Biden team as well.

At last year‚Äôs NATO gathering in Vilnius, the US delegation made it very clear that no further US military forces would be earmarked for Europe beyond those already allocated at the 2022 summit in Madrid.

European nations are also being increasingly pushed to take over more responsibility for arming Ukraine. This week‚Äôs Washington summit yielded a deal to release additional US-made Patriot air defence missiles to the government in Kyiv.

Monday‚Äôs missile strike on a children‚Äôs hospital in the Ukrainian capital, which killed at least 38 people, will have raised the urgency of that requirement.

But US officials and other experts increasingly worry about declining US stocks of missiles as well as other forms of ammunition. The US makes less than 700 Patriots a year, although new factories including in Germany should increase that over time.

The worst-case scenario, officials in Washington, Brussels and above all Eastern Europe increasingly believe, is that what both sides now call the ‚Äúno limits‚Äù partnership between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping one day prompts Beijing to encourage Moscow to launch a limited land grab against exposed NATO nations such as the Baltic states.

Such a move could leave US forces struggling to simultaneously confront Russia and China on opposite sides of the world ‚Äì and make it much easier for China to achieve potential military ambitions, including a Taiwan invasion.

Others, however, suggest the Russia-China partnership may already be showing its limits. Last week, the leaders of both nations and eight other countries ‚Äì including new member Belarus ‚Äì met in Kazakhstan for a gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, sometimes referred to as a Russian and Chinese-dominated counterweight to Western NATO structures.

For all the diplomatic smiles, however, Moscow and Beijing are also effectively competitors for influence across Central Asia and beyond. Russian troops do not appear to have been invited to the China-Belarus drills currently underway.

The world is getting more complicated. NATO appears to have decided it cannot ignore events in the Pacific. China, for its part, is signalling that it also views the European continent as part of an increasingly contested planet.

 Environment in peril: Act now ,"
                        
                        
                        We recently travelled to a village in Satkhira, and Kuakata in Patuakhali, and stayed there for a few days during a heatwave. There were frequent power cuts, leaving us without fans or air conditioning. The stillness of the air made it unbearable, and almost everyone became tired and sick. Women, who cook and take care of families, as well as those out for work ‚Äì rickshaw pullers, farmers, people with disabilities, and the elderly ‚Äì suffered the most.
In Satkhira and Patuakhali, drinking water is a significant challenge due to its high salt content. The declining water table has rendered normal tubewells ineffective, leaving only deep tubewells functional. Consequently, many families must purchase water, which is expensive. Many people cannot consume the necessary amount of water, leading to dehydration and various illnesses such as heat stroke, high blood pressure, and skin diseases. Women and adolescent girls are particularly affected, with their sexual and reproductive health (SRH) at risk. The situation has also exacerbated gender-based violence. Women and girls spend two to three hours collecting a single bucket of water, often facing sexual abuse and having to drop out of school.
A UNICEF-WHO report from 2023 highlights that globally, 1.8 billion people live in households without water supplies on the premises. In seven out of 10 such households, women and girls aged 15 and older are primarily responsible for water collection, compared to 3 in 10 households for their male peers. Girls under 15 (7 percent) are also more likely than boys under 15 (4 percent) to fetch water. Women and girls typically undertake longer journeys to collect water, losing valuable time for education, work, and leisure, while also risking physical injury and danger.
The situation in coastal areas is deteriorating. Cyclone Remal recently caused heavy rain and storm damage, leading to flooding in many villages with fragile embankments. The cyclone made a devastating landfall in southern Bangladesh, affecting 3.7 million people and disrupting lives, livelihoods, and education, while worsening living conditions. Many people may be displaced internally, placing a heavy burden on women and girls. Girls often become victims of child marriage, with Bangladesh having one of the highest prevalence rates of child marriage globally ‚Äî51 percent of children marry before the age of 18, according to the Girls Not Brides website.
We are experiencing heatwaves, water crises, and air pollution due to environmental degradation. Our environment sustains us, but we are failing to protect it. We use plastics that pollute water and land, chemicals that degrade soil and water, and we build homes and industries by grabbing land and cutting trees, leading to deforestation. The lack of adequate rainfall is causing droughts in many parts of Bangladesh. According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, up to 40 percent of the planet‚Äôs land is degraded, directly affecting half of the world‚Äôs population. The number and duration of droughts have increased by 29% since 2000. Without urgent action, droughts may affect over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050.
We are running out of time. Significant damage has already occurred. We need to take care of our planet, land, water, and environment. Global warming is intensifying. To keep global warming below 1.5¬∞C this century, we must halve annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Without action, exposure to air pollution beyond safe guidelines will increase by 50 percent within the decade, and plastic waste flowing into aquatic ecosystems will nearly triple by 2040. We need to act now.
Every year, the United Nations Environment Programme celebrates World Environment Day. This year, the focus is on land restoration, desertification, and drought resilience, with the slogan: ‚ÄúOur Land, Our Future.‚Äù We are the Generation Restoration. Our actions to protect the environment should not be confined to just one day. We must commit to protecting our environment every day of the year so that we can enjoy a breath of fresh air on this planet.

 Laughter is the best medicine. Is it? ,"
                        
                        
                        ‚ÄúLaughter is the sun that drives winter from the human face.‚Äù ‚Äî Victor Hugo

When was the last time you laughed wholeheartedly? 

How do you feel after laughing? I believe this question itself has prompted some of you to smile. It does feel good to smile-right? It brings a kind of satisfaction, a sense of relief - doesn‚Äôt it? 

Today, May 5, 2024, is World Laughter Day. 

Few of us realise how valuable laughter is. 

That‚Äôs what World Laughter Day is for! It‚Äôs a day of great significance to promote awareness about the numerous benefits of laughter and its healing benefits. Thousands of community groups in most large cities around the world, regularly, practice comedy inducing laughter that promotes our wellness and overall well-being. 

Though World Laughter Day is celebrated worldwide, it has its origins in India. Dr Madan Kataria, a Mumbai-based doctor, was studying the effects of facial expressions on mood. He realised the positive effects of laughter and smile on the body. So he founded the Laughter Yoga Movement in 1995 to create awareness of these positive effects. Later, to spread the message to the world, he created World Laughter Day in 1998. The first World Laughter Day was observed in Mumbai on May 10. The day is an annual celebration held on the first Sunday of May, and this year it falls on May 5 worldwide. This Day has since been observed in creative and enjoyable ways worldwide. Thanks to the internet!

Laughter is normally an involuntary reflex, but it can also be a conscious action that we can employ to enjoy its mental and physical benefits. Dr Kataria, interestingly, points out that there is no difference between pretended laughter and real laughter for the body, as long as the laughter is deep.

Laughter yoga isn‚Äôt about thinking of something funny but it‚Äôs a combination of laughter exercises with breathing techniques which, like other types of yoga, supports our physical and mental well-being. It helps intake of oxygen in our body and brain. A fifteen minute of this combined exercise can reduce stress and make our immune systems stronger. The physical and health benefits can be felt, after regularly attending these exercises.

In different parts of the world, community groups regularly practise simple laughter techniques to promote wellness and overall well-being. These community groups are known as Laughter Clubs.

For over 26 years, thousands of people from more than 120 countries get together and celebrate World Laughter Day. The Day is celebrated by laughter club members, their families and friends assembling together in city squares, public parks, beaches, or even online to laugh. There are a variety of music and dance programmes and laughter contests. The Day can be celebrated by anyone, but it‚Äôs mostly observed in cities where large groups of people gather to laugh and bond together and spread joy. Laughter is a universal language. The power of laughter can unite us and help overcome many obstacles.

The day promotes global consciousness of fellowship and friendship through laughter - positive manifestation of world peace. Laughter club members participate in peace marches,carrying banners and placards written ‚ÄúWorld Peace Through Laughter,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Whole World Is An Extended Family‚Äù etc. 

‚ÄúAlways laugh when you can. It is cheap medicine.‚Äù ‚Äî Lord Byron

There are a number of health benefits associated with laughing:

‚Ä¢ First of all laughter helps us connect with those we‚Äôre laughing with and creates a bond of friendship. It can also help form bonds with strangers and facilitate positive communication.

‚Ä¢ Releases endorphins (happiness hormone) which are natural painkillers within our bodies and can ease chronic pain. In addition, the brain releases a balanced level of dopamine, which causes feelings of happiness.

‚Ä¢ Reduces the level of stress hormones; 

‚Ä¢ Boosts T-cells, a type of white blood cell in the immune system. When activated these help protect the body from infections and may help fight cancer. 

‚Ä¢ Helps intake of oxygen which is good for the lungs and heart.

‚Ä¢ Regulates the heart rate improving heart function and reducing blood pressure.  

‚Ä¢ Helps increase blood flow and improves the function of blood vessels, Lowers blood pressure which in turn can reduce the risk of a heart attack or a stroke.

‚Ä¢ Tones abs as it makes the muscles in the tummy expand and contract.

‚Ä¢ Helps burn about 40 calories (laughing for 10-15 minutes) -specially recommended for those who are unable to do physical activities because of illness or injury. 

‚Ä¢ Helps in social interactions by creating a more comfortable and relaxed environment. 

The neurologist Sigmund Freud also stressed on the importance of laughter. He opined that it releases suppressed emotions resulting from stress or nervousness.

One of the best examples of the positive physical effects came from Professor Norman Cousins, a famous 20th-century writer.  He was diagnosed with a serious illness in his late forties. He moved with difficulty and suffered from constant pain. He was told that he had a limited time to live. He thought if stress or negative emotions can cause illness, then maybe positive emotions can help in getting better. He started watching comedy films on his sick bed. Daily laughter became a part of his daily life. Along with laughter, he started taking high doses of Vitamin C. Amazingly, within six months he recovered well, and within two years he started to work.

Though laughter has many benefits, it should be remembered that sometimes we may be struggling with medical conditions like anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies or trauma which require professional assistance. Don‚Äôt neglect it. Laughter isn‚Äôt an alternative to physical, psychological or psychiatric care. Immediately, consult a health professional. 

Life isn‚Äôt a bed of roses. There are certain times when we are struck with grief or sadness. Acknowledge those. Give some time to yourselves. But remember prolonged periods of grief or sadness can have a negative impact on us. Laughter gives us the impetus to lighten and improve our mood. Watch a comedy movie; get together with friends or family and have a fun time: Laugh, share jokes and move on with a healthy and productive life full of positivity. 

Laughter is good for the soul and body. It may not solve critical conditions, but it does makeus feel better.

‚ÄúI am especially glad of the divine gift of laughter: it has made the world human and lovable, despite all its pain and wrong.‚Äù ‚Äî WEB Du Bois

World Laughter Day is a good time to start adopting wellness strategies in our homes, classrooms, offices and communities. We should also incorporate these into our daily lives to ensure that we benefit physically and mentally from all that laughter brings.

‚ÄúA day without laughing is a day wasted‚Äù - Charlie Chaplin 

So, let‚Äôs share some jokes, go to a comedy show with friends, watch a funny movie, have some fun and spread some joy throughout our communities on World Laughter Day.

‚ÄúI have not seen anyone dying of laughter, but I know millions who are dying because they are not laughing.‚Äù ‚Äî Dr Madan Kataria

In stressful situations, take a deep breath, smile and laugh. Take every opportunity to laugh as it aids to cope with stress and makes us feel positive about life.

Most of us take ourselves too seriously! Take this opportunity today to learn to laugh at yourself too.

We have all heard that laughter is the best medicine. Is it? 

It may not be the best medicine but it does work as balm to the human body and soul. Laugh and enjoy the world around you. 

Life is for the living -smile and laugh your way through this journey.

 Balancing act: The journey of Bangladesh's IT industry between protectionism and global aspirations ,"
                        
                        
                        Amid the vibrant hustle of South Asia, Bangladesh positions itself on the launching pad of the global information technology arena. It is a land ripe with potential, ready to leverage the energy of its youthful workforce and echo its past economic triumphs on the digital stage. The nation now faces a pivotal challenge, one that will define its future success: how to establish a robust IT industry that can compete internationally while fostering an environment that encourages local innovation and growth. This delicate balancing act ‚Äî nurturing 'Global Competency Acquisition' and 'Local Ecosystem Efficiency' ‚Äî sets the course for the country's advancement in the IT sector.

Global Competency Acquisition embodies the process of assimilating knowledge, best practices, and technological prowess from established international tech giants. Conversely, Local Ecosystem Efficiency focuses on building indigenous capabilities to deliver IT services in a cost-effective and expedient manner. 

The interplay between these two concepts will shape Bangladesh's approach to joining the ranks of the world's IT leaders. As such, the government and industry pioneers look to the nation's thriving readymade garments (RMG) sector and the flourishing IT market of their Indian counterparts for strategic insight. These models stand as testaments to the power of aligning local specialisation with global standards and offer guidance for the IT sector's onward journey.

BANGLADESH'S RMG SECTOR: A BLUEPRINT FOR GLOBAL MARKET PENETRATION

The meteoric rise of Bangladesh's RMG sector stands as a masterclass in strategic economic positioning and resilience. From modest beginnings, the industry has catapulted to become the world's second-largest apparel exporter, not solely through cost efficiencies but through strategic global market integration. 

The RMG success story is rooted in robust government policies, a commitment to capacity building, and above all, a readiness to collaborate with international partners and markets without heavy reliance on protectionism.

This openness to the global economy allowed for a critical exchange of knowledge and practices, cultivating 'Local Ecosystem Efficiency.' Bangladeshi manufacturers developed agile production systems that could swiftly adapt to fashion currents and deliver products across the globe with remarkable speed and efficiency. 

Facilitating this transformation was a deliberate emphasis on 'Global Competency Acquisition.' The RMG sector did not grow in isolation; it thrived on partnerships, technology transfers, and skill-sharing initiatives with international entities. 

These cross-border engagements enabled Bangladeshi manufacturers to upgrade their processes, embrace global compliance standards, and infuse innovation into their workflows‚Äîultimately capturing the trust and business of top international fashion brands.
The experience of the RMG industry illustrates that for Bangladesh, embracing global best practices and standards while cultivating a strong local framework is not a paradox but a synergistic strategy. 

By fostering an environment that invites international collaboration and knowledge exchange, the IT sector can secure its place as a formidable contender on the global stage‚Äîone that is as dynamic and forward-thinking as the digital era itself.

INDIA'S IT SECTOR: A BENCHMARK FOR VERSATILITY AND GLOBAL COLLABORATION

In the global IT narrative, the ascent of India's information technology sector is a remarkable chapter. India's model of growth in the IT domain is characterised not just by the scale but by the strategic depth it has embraced‚Äîa harmonious mixture of both Global Competency Acquisition and deep Local Ecosystem Efficiency.

Global collaboration has been a cornerstone of India‚Äôs success. Indian IT companies quickly recognised the value in forging partnerships with multinational corporations, which brought not only immediate business opportunities but also long-term benefits such as knowledge transfer, skill development, and exposure to global business practices. 

The Indian IT workforce thus became adept in handling complex projects, with expertise spanning across numerous technologies and domains‚Äîa testament to effective Global Competency Acquisition. This movement towards a knowledge-based economy set a precedent for strategic collaboration and skill enhancement.
For Bangladesh, India‚Äôs example is instructive. To create a versatile IT contender, embracing a multi-faceted approach that values both specialisation and adaptability is essential. 

Bangladesh's IT sector should strive to build its global competence by engaging with international tech firms, participating in global dialogues, and forming strategic partnerships that would facilitate transfer of technology and best practices.

Emulating India is not about copying its model identically but rather adopting its approach of versatility and symbiotic global engagements. 

A STRATEGIC SHIFT THROUGH GLOBAL COMPETENCY ACQUISITION AND LOCAL ECOSYSTEM EFFICIENCY 

As Bangladesh boasts an expansive IT and ITES sector, with over 4,500 firms and 750,000+ ICT professionals, the current challenge lies in harnessing this domestic momentum for global competition. The burgeoning domestic market, having achieved more than $1.4 billion in size with projections indicating a forecasted growth of 22 percent between 2018-2025, underscores the tremendous economic potential.

Meanwhile, the explosive growth of freelancing, with 650,000+ registered individuals, alongside the strides in BPO ($300 million market size in 2018 and 71 percent growth since 2012), e-commerce (over $2.5 billion in market size in 2020 and an expected $3.6 billion by 2023), and mobile and internet usage (180 million subscribers and 128 million users respectively, and an engaged social media audience of 62 million), reveals a highly engaged digital workforce and consumer base. 

However, despite these robust indicators, the sector's international reach largely remains anchored to the unstructured contributions of freelancers whose efforts, although substantial, do not necessarily mirror the scale and consistency required to contend on the global stage.
To usher in a new phase of structured and standardised industry growth, Bangladesh can draw on the blueprint laid by India's IT ascension, where welcoming global IT giants fuelled a revolution of professionalism, entrepreneurship, and international compliance within the sector. 
Entrusting fostered relationships with these titans offers more than just employment opportunities - it paves the way for intellectual and experiential transfer. 

Additionally, the domestic workforce, including freelancers and emerging talents, can attain new levels of proficiency through exposure to global operational frameworks, quality norms, and innovative technological landscapes.
 
Given these enhanced capabilities, Bangladesh could dramatically increase its share of IT exports beyond the $1 billion milestone of 2019, building upon the solid 21 percent growth rate from 2013-2019.

Global companies setting up shops in Bangladesh create fertile training grounds where freelancers and new IT professionals can develop into internationally-minded experts. This transfer of knowledge and practice cultivates a breed of global entrepreneurs, mirroring the industry trajectory seen in India, wherein the presence and practices of international firms effectively upskilled the local workforce to eventually lead their enterprises.

To capture this opportunity, Bangladesh must prioritise improving industry standards domestically, creating an environment conducive to international investment, and signalling readiness for global integration. 

Strategic policies and incentives that attract such firms, coupled with rigorous adherence to global quality benchmarks, will strengthen the capacity of local firms and individuals alike.
In tandem, there should be a concerted effort toward skill enhancement and continuous learning. Initiatives could include establishing IT excellence centres in partnership with global giants, easing regulatory frameworks, and fostering innovation hubs that encourage creative problem-solving aligned with global trends.

Realising this vision requires deliberate and concerted actions from both public stakeholders and private enterprises. 

By incentivising the entry of renowned multinational corporations and prioritising infrastructure and talent development, Bangladesh can reshape its IT landscape. 

This strategic pivot would not only empower local talents to ascend the global hierarchy but also reinforce the IT sector's role as a cornerstone of the nation‚Äôs economic engine, building resilient, sustainable, and globally competitive market footholds.

On the journey towards global prominence, Bangladesh can draw inspiration from the successes encountered in its own RMG sector and the ascension of India‚Äôs IT industry, using these models as guiding beacons.

Bangladesh's proactive engagement in the global IT arena, combined with local skill development, envisions its IT sector as a global leader rather than merely a competitor. 

The reward of this meticulous orchestration is a sustainable, vibrant IT industry that can proudly represent Bangladesh on the global stage, bringing prosperity and recognition to the nation.

 Oil bulls lack conviction about sustainability of higher prices ,"
                        
                        
                        Investors boosted their exposure to Brent as the conflict between Iran and Israel escalated but there was selling across the rest of the petroleum complex amid doubts about the sustainability of higher prices.


Hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 23 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts over the seven days ending on April 16.


Purchases of Brent (+31 million barrels) were more than offset by sales of NYMEX and ICE WTI (-35 million), US gasoline (-5 million), US diesel (-5 million) and European gas oil (-9 million).

Brent is most exposed to production and shipping disruptions as a result of conflict in the Middle East and fund managers boosted their net position to 335 million barrels (75th percentile for all weeks since 2013).

But much of this additional exposure seems to have rotated out from WTI, where funds sold at the fastest rate for 10 weeks and the net position was trimmed to just 183 million barrels (31st percentile).

While fund managers had become strongly bullish on Brent they were increasingly bearish about prospects for WTI.

In the premier NYMEX WTI contract, there was evidence of a fresh cycle of short selling, which had started four weeks earlier when prices climbed above $80 per barrel.

Fund managers had boosted short positions equivalent to 71 million barrels by April 16, up from 23 million on March 19.

In refined fuels, previous bullishness about a continued depletion of inventories and a further rise in prices had also started to ebb away.

The hedge fund community is broadly bullish about the outlook for both crude and fuel prices but not with much conviction.

Bullish long positions outnumber bearish short ones by a ratio of 3.60:1 which is in only the 42nd percentile for all weeks since 2013.

There are upside risks from Middle East conflict, production restraint by Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ allies, and a cyclical economic upswing in the United States

But these are offset by downside risks from strong growth in non-OPEC output, persistent inflation, higher-for-longer interest rates, and a desultory economic recovery in Europe and China.

Escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has masked a slight deterioration of investor sentiment about the outlook for oil prices in recent weeks.

Once the conflict appeared to have been contained, with Israel‚Äôs limited retaliation against Iran, prices have retreated.


US NATURAL GAS

Investors turned more bearish towards US natural gas as the seasonal inventory surplus continued to swell and stocks climbed near to a record high for the time of year.

Hedge funds and other money managers sold the equivalent of 173 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the two most important futures and options contracts linked to prices at Henry Hub in Louisiana.

The rate of selling was the fastest for eight weeks since mid-February, before some of the largest producers announced they would be scaling back drilling and production.

As a result, funds held a net short position of 483 bcf (19th percentile for all weeks since 2010) versus a net short of 310 bcf (25th percentile) the week before.

Working gas inventories amounted to 2,333 bcf on April 12, the highest for the time of year since 2016 and before that 2012.

Inventories were an enormous 641 bcf (+38% or +1.38 standard deviations) above the prior ten-year average and the surplus shows no sign so far of narrowing despite prices close to multi-decade lows in real terms.

In December, the latest month for which data is available, power generators paid the lowest seasonal prices for gas since 1974, after adjusting for inflation. Since then, the real acquisition cost has likely fallen even further.

But the warmest winter on record has depressed consumption of both gas and electricity, ensuring that inventories have remained exceptionally high and postponing any rebound in prices.

 Is China stockpiling oil and other resources in case of future war? ,"
                        
                        
                        In the eastern Chinese port of Dongying, the start of 2024 has often seen several tankers docked simultaneously discharging Russian crude oil into a new 31.5 million barrel storage facility completed late last year.


It is, traders say, all part of a concerted and deliberate Chinese effort to build up strategic stockpiles for a perhaps uncertain future. 


Estimates of China's total strategic energy reserve vary from 280 to 400 million barrels, the upper amount exceeding the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve at roughly 364 million. China consumes some 14 million barrels a day of oil in peacetime.

What does seem clear, however, is that China is deliberately stockpiling at speed, part of a much wider national effort to accumulate essential raw materials and resource.

When it comes to energy, much of the new inflows now come primarily from Russia, whose energy exports to China rose by roughly one quarter last year to a record 2.14 million barrels per day. 

That makes the Kremlin Beijing's largest energy supplier for the second year running, overtaking Saudi Arabia ‚Äì and allowing China to benefit from substantially discounted Russian oil as US and Western sanctions have turned away multiple other buyers since Vladimir Putin‚Äôs 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Beijing‚Äôs stockpiling of oil is just one example of what appears a broad national effort to significantly increase the holdings of key raw materials. It is a move that some increasingly suspect is intended to help insulate Beijing against any future war or international sanctions, such as those that might be sparked by a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

In a piece for international affairs and conflict blogging site ‚ÄúWar on the Rocks‚Äù published April 17, Mike Studeman, former commander of the US Office of Naval Intelligence and intelligence and director of the US Indo-Pacific Command, argued that this was part of a much wider process. 

""Xi Jinping is preparing his country for a showdown,"" he wrote, describing the Chinese leader as ""militarising Chinese society and steeling his country for a potential high-intensity war."" 

Part of that, he suggested, included building up strategic stockpiles of essential goods and resources, protecting China against the kind of sanctions imposed on Russia after its Ukraine invasion ‚Äì or, indeed, a militarily enforced blockade as part of a regional or global war.

Other examples of heightened preparedness, he said, included the much higher tempo of Chinese military operations around Taiwan ‚Äì designed to both exercise China‚Äôs military and implicitly threaten the government in Taipei with the consequences of its own total military blockade. 

US officials say they believe Xi has given his armed forces until 2027 to be prepared to invade Taiwan, although those inside and outside the US government remain divided on whether a decision to actually attack has genuinely been made. 

This week, the outgoing head of the US Indo-Pacific Command said Beijing was continuing to plough resources into its military despite economic turmoil caused by a real estate crisis and a slump in US-China trade.

""Despite a failing economy, there is a conscious decision to fund military capability,"" Admiral John Aquilino told a naval conference in Japan. ""That's concerning to me.""

What is clear, Western experts and officials say, is that the government in Beijing has learned multiple lessons from Russia‚Äôs troubled experience in Ukraine. 

These include the desirability of managing any military takeover extremely quickly, presenting the outside world ‚Äì and particularly the US ‚Äì with a lightning change of government in Taiwan‚Äôs capital Taipei before anyone can truly react.


COMMUNICATIONS

Over the last year, US President Joe Biden and counterpart Xi have held one relatively cordial meeting in California in November and at least one follow-on bilateral telephone call, while military officials have held direct meetings aimed at finding ways to ensure communication and reduce tensions in any future crisis.

So far, neither Washington nor other Western states have moved to significantly cut China off from raw materials, although the US has increasingly worked to strip Beijing of access to high-tech microchips, particularly those that could be used for weapons. 

European states remain publicly divided over their approaches to Beijing, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting China this month in what appeared to be an effort to maintain ongoing trade links.

German officials say Scholz pressed Chinese counterparts including Xi on multiple issues including human rights and Beijing's support for Russia in Ukraine.

More broadly, however, Western-Chinese relations continue to deteriorate ‚Äì and not just over Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province with which it vows to pursue ‚Äúreunification‚Äù either peaceably or by force. 

This month, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told fellow NATO foreign ministers that ever more Chinese components were being found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine. Beijing‚Äôs support for Moscow, Blinken said, was approaching the threshold of delivering lethal weapons systems.

This week also saw two rounds of arrests in Europe linked to alleged espionage by China, including two parliamentary researchers in Britain and three Germans working on defense programs. China‚Äôs embassies in both countries denied involvement in spying.

Having initially recovered following the COVID pandemic, US-Chinese trade nosedived in 2023 and so far shows little signs of recovering. 

Officials in both the US and Europe also say they are considering introducing trade tariffs on Chinese production of electric vehicles in particular, accusing Beijing of deliberate overproduction in a way that threatens US and European rivals. 

Should such tariffs be introduced, relations would almost certainly deteriorate still further.

China‚Äôs government buyers have never been ones to turn down a bargain, frequently building up their national stockpiles when short-term prices fall. Newly imposed Western sanctions on Russian nickel, aluminium and copper that entered force this month are seen as likely to spur further Chinese buying.

When it comes to lithium, a vital component in many types of battery, Beijing has bought up not just stock but also processing facilities and mines, including overseas. 

In March, investment bank UBS estimated that China might control a third of all global lithium supply as soon as 2025, again exploiting a price crash to further build its holdings.

A US Geological Survey report from 2016 showed China's mineral deposits containing aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, iridium, tantalum, tin, tungsten, zinc and zirconium as well as other rare earth elements.

Since then, China has sometimes sold off elements of its strategic reserves when prices have been particularly high, thereby reducing the costs for Chinese industry. More broadly, however, those stockpiles have continued to grow.

When it comes to one particular commodity, those purchases appear to go well beyond the government. Chinese consumers and companies, as well as state institutions, have been on a particular buying spree this year for gold, pushing its global price to a record high above $2,400 an ounce.

That has prompted speculation that China is about to make a concerted effort to wean itself and other major emerging economies off their long-term dependence on the US dollar. 

But it may also be a reflection that China‚Äôs elite expect a more dangerous-feeling world over the rest of the 2020s and beyond, and would rather consolidate their wealth within Chinese borders well before that situation worsens.

 A call to recognise the genocide in Bangladesh on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day ,"
                        
                        
                        

Apr 24 is the Rememberance Day of the Armenian Genocide. Let us honour and remember the lives lost in the unfathomable tragedy of the Armenian genocide, ensuring that their memory endures through our commitment to truth and justice. In 2021, under President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration, the United States government took the significant step of formally recognising the Armenian genocide. This recognition goes beyond being a mere historical notation; it is a crucial validation of the extensive suffering endured by the Armenian people during the Ottoman Empire.





An additional abhorrent chapter was written in 1971 when the genocide occurred in the region presently referred to as Bangladesh, which was previously East Pakistan. The Pakistani Occupation Force, along with groups like Al Badr, Al Shams, and Razakar, unleashed unimaginable brutality against the Bengali community, who were seeking liberation from oppressive rule. Mar 25, 1971 marked the official start of the atrocity. The international media, including reputable outlets like the New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, and The Times of London, covered the unfolding tragedy extensively. Yet, decisive action to stop the bloodshed remained elusive.

During the 1971 crisis in Dhaka, amidst the Bangladesh Liberation War, US Consul General Archer Blood and other American companions personally witnessed the atrocities being committed. They were deeply disturbed by the violence inflicted upon the Bengali population by the Pakistani military. Blood, demonstrating exceptional moral courage, meticulously documented these events in a series of diplomatic cables known as the ‚ÄúBlood Telegrams‚Äù. In these cables, he unambiguously condemned the crackdown and called for more assertive intervention by the United States to stop the violence. His dispatches explicitly opposed the Nixon administration's policy of tacit support for Pakistan, revealing a profound concern for human rights and democratic principles. Blood‚Äôs stance gained notable support from a group within the US State Department known as the ‚Äúdissent channel‚Äù. This mechanism was established to allow diplomats to directly express dissenting views to senior officials. The existence of this group serves as a testament to the values of democratic governance and moral responsibility.

At the same time, during this dark period, voices of conscience echoed around the world, calling for an end to the carnage. Figures like US Senator Edward Kennedy, Mother Teresa, and French writer Andr√© Malraux, among others, raised their voices in solidarity with the victims and called for international intervention. However, despite these passionate pleas, the world‚Äôs response remained muted, allowing the atrocities to continue unpunished.

We owe a debt of gratitude to Archer Blood and all those who courageously opposed their government‚Äôs policy. They advocated for justice and shed light on grave human rights abuses. Their integrity and bravery remain exemplary and continue to inspire those in positions of power to uphold the principles of humanity and justice.





The brutality inflicted upon the Bengali population during the genocide is almost incomprehensible. Widespread massacres, organised sexual violence, deliberate extermination, torture, and coerced displacement were prevalent, resulting in extensive devastation. The Bengali guerrillas, who courageously resisted the Pakistani forces, faced overwhelming odds but refused to give up their fight for freedom. Their resilience in the face of adversity is a testament to the indomitable spirit of humanity.

Amidst the horrors in East Pakistan, the roles of India and the Soviet Union became crucial in shaping the course of events. India, faced with a humanitarian crisis on its doorstep, provided vital support to the Bengali liberation movement, ultimately leading to the birth of Bangladesh. The Soviet Union also played a pivotal role by diplomatically supporting India‚Äôs efforts to end the genocide and secure international recognition for Bangladesh's independence. Despite the passage of decades, the wounds inflicted by the Bangladesh genocide continue to worsen, requiring acknowledgement and redress. 

In recent years, the recognition of the genocide in Bangladesh has received support from various institutions. In April 2023, the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) officially classified this tragic event as genocide, following the necessary protocols, in response to my formal proposal. This acknowledgment was the result of the collective efforts of several genocide specialists and scholars who supported me throughout the entire process. Prior to this, between December 2021 and March 2022, three other US organisations - the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention, Genocide Watch, and the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience - also formally recognised these events as genocide. Fortunately, I was able to play a significant role in obtaining recognition from Genocide Watch and the Lemkin Institute.

However, recognition alone is not sufficient. Concurrently, the US government needs to own up to its role in the genocide in Bangladesh and issue a formal resolution denouncing the crimes of Pakistan and its allies. On Oct 15, 2022, US Congressmen Steve Chabot and Ro Khanna, who are of Indian American descent, introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives urging the US Ppresident to acknowledge the genocide against ethnic Bengalis and Hindu community by the Pakistani armed forces in 1971. Also it calls on Pakistan to apologise for its role in the genocide of Bangladesh. The resolution mentioned the recognition awarded by the Genocide Watch and the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention. Unfortunately, this draft resolution has remained undiscussed and undecided after 1.5 years. It‚Äôs time to take action and bring this matter to a close.  

Additionally, the United Nations must apologise for its failure to prevent the genocide and formally recognise it as such; incorporating the lessons learned into its genocide prevention efforts.

Furthermore, there must be ongoing international pressure applied to Pakistan to acknowledge its role in the genocide and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. Justice delayed is justice denied, and the victims of the Bangladesh genocide deserve full accountability for the atrocities committed against them.

In conclusion, the recognition of the genocide in Bangladesh surpasses a mere retrospective analysis of historical events; it carries profound moral implications. It emphasises our steadfast commitment to the principle of ""never again"" and showcases the remarkable resilience of humanity in confronting unimaginable acts of violence. The active involvement of the US government and the United Nations holds significant importance in this endeavour. By acknowledging and addressing past atrocities, actually we honour the memory of the victims and reassert our collective determination to build a future where such atrocities are consigned to the past.

 Let‚Äôs nurture our Mother Earth ,"
                        
                        
                        

What does a mother do?

She nurtures her children. She prepares food for them and provides clothing and protection. She loves them, cherishes, educates and helps them to live a happy life. These are the things that our Earth provides us with. This is why we call her Mother Nature or Mother Earth.  





‚ÄòI nurture you, I build you strong.

Fresh air, sweet water and arable land all around. 

I nourish you in the womb, 

I nurture you in my lap all year round

I am Mother Nature

Mess with me; I create destruction all around‚Äô
 

Yes, this is Mother Nature giving us so much and nourishing us all the time. Yet, what have we done? We have only brought destruction to this earth with our mindless acts. Now Mother Nature is lashing back in anger to teach us a lesson to take care of her, for our survival. 

We have taken the world for granted. Our greed to control nature and exploit all its resources to have more and more on our platters for consumption and profit making has affected the ozone layer, destroyed the natural balance of the ecosystem and brought many natural disasters. Our greed has resulted in an impending doom.

Experts predict that we‚Äôre in the midst of a sixth mass extinction.

In a mass extinction, a high percentage of biodiversity, or distinct species ‚Äì bacteria, fungi, plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates die in a short period of geological time. When one or more species go extinct or if there‚Äôs a significant population decline, it can‚Äôt continue its proper balance, threatening the survival of other species in the whole ecosystem. There have been five previous mass extinctions on the planet. The last one occurred 65.5 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs. 

Those extinctions were the results of natural phenomena.

Sadly, human activities are responsible for the upcoming sixth mass extinction due to the unsustainable use of land, water and energy. We, human beings, are in dire need of taking care of our environment to exist on this planet.

We aren‚Äôt only over-exploiting available resources but also generating immense pollution that disrupts biodiversity. The environment is being destroyed by pollution from factories, plastic waste, and deforestation, intensified agriculture and livestock production accelerating the destruction of our Earth leading to one of the biggest threats to human survival: climate change.





The recent flooding in Dubai is likely the result of global warming. Climate change and global warming are also the likely cause of the ongoing heatwaves in Bangladesh. A seasonal high heat record of ocean temperature is witnessed globally. It‚Äôs a grave threat to some marine life. Extreme heat can result in a range of illnesses and death, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

If preventive measures aren‚Äôt taken in time, life-sustaining biodiversity will continue to lose at an alarming rate threatening humanity‚Äôs future.

Following a decade of local protests for air and water pollution in the United States, Earth Day was launched at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco in 1969. Earth Day was held for the first time in California, US on Apr 22, 1970. The first international recognition of the interdependence of humans, other living things, and our planet was established during the UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972. It led to the establishment of World Environment Day on 5th June and the UN Environment program. World Earth Day serves as a reminder that we are part of a complex ecosystem and that the health of the earth is deeply correlated with our well-being.

The United Nations General Assembly designated Apr 22 as International Mother Earth Day through a resolution adopted in 2009, joining groups that had previously celebrated Earth Day on the same date.

Both these days and World Environment Day focus on raising our awareness about global environmental challenges facing our planet: from climate change and deforestation to pollution and loss of biodiversity and sustainable resource management.

It doesn‚Äôt only create awareness but it calls for collective action to take proactive measures for environmental conservation worldwide; to restore the damages we have caused to nature and to nurture nature and the Earth for a harmonious relationship; to achieve a balance for the economic, social, and environmental needs of the present and future generations of humanity; and adopt eco-friendly practices. 

The theme for World Earth Day 2024 by the official Earth Day organisers, EARTHDAY.ORG is ‚ÄúPlanet vs. Plastics‚Äù. 

The theme aims to increase public awareness of the harmful effects of plastic pollution on the environment and its inhabitants. Its focus is to continue a concerted effort globally to significantly reduce the use of plastic, and decrease 60 percent of plastic manufacture by 2040.




The Planet vs Plastics campaign is a call to arms, a demand that we act now to end the scourge of plastics and safeguard the health of every living being upon our planet.
Kathleen Rogers





Plastic is one of the most produced materials as it is cheap, easy to manufacture and use. During the whole life cycle of plastic production, it causes toxic gas emissions resulting in grave risks. Some plastics are life-threatening when combusted. It‚Äôs mainly produced from fossil fuels: oil and gas. The more plastic we make, the more fossil fuel is required, and the more we aggravate the climate crisis. 

Do you know that making a plastic water bottle requires six times as much water as the bottle itself contains? What a waste of water supply as well!

Some plastics are imperishable for centuries, polluting and threatening each living being. According to EarthDay.Org, worldwide more than 500 billion plastic bags were produced per minute last year, almost half of which is for ‚Äòsingle- use.‚Äô The huge volume of ‚Äòsingle-use‚Äô plastic waste ends up in lands, rivers, and oceans, and when exposed to environmental conditions such as solar irradiation and abrasion, it slowly breaks down, releasing micro- and nano-plastic, which is consumed by small marine organisms, entering the food chain and air causing starvation or death.

According to the UN website, 11 million tonnes of plastic waste flow annually into lakes, rivers and oceans. Over 800 marine and coastal species are affected by this pollution through ingestion, entanglement, and other dangers.

Plastic poses a grave threat to human life as well. It releases toxic chemicals into our food and water sources and circulates through the air we breathe. It‚Äôs estimated that each person annually consumes more than 50,000 plastic particles and more if inhalation is considered. These flow through our bloodstream and stick to our internal organs causing cancer and other life-threatening diseases.

It‚Äôs crucial to halve the annual greenhouse gas emissions. If we fail, air pollution beyond safe guidelines will skyrocket by 50 per cent within the decade; almost tripling plastic waste into aquatic ecosystems by 2040.

In 2022, 175 UN Member States signed a significant historic resolution to end plastic pollution and form a legally binding international agreement that will be ready by the end of 2024. 




A shift to a circular economy can reduce the volume of plastics entering oceans by over 80per cent by 2040; reduce virgin plastic production by 55 percent; save governments $70 billion by 2040; reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent; and create 700,000 additional jobs ‚Äì mainly in the global south.
UNEP





To tackle the curse of plastic pollution and achieve this target, urgent action and effective solutions can only be made by collaboration of the governments, businesses and individuals. Governments need to make bold environmental policies to push extended producer and consumer responsibilities. Each of us has a role. Along with necessary policy changes by the government, behavioural changes of manufacturers and consumers can make a huge difference

Packaging professionals must also be dedicated to adopting environmentally sustainable methods and finding revolutionary solutions for recycling the plastic packaging already in circulation. Manufacturers must label clear messages and produce materials to make recycling easier for consumers. 

We, the consumers must make an effort and be a part of the ‚ÄòGo Green‚Äô campaign by recycling bottles, plastics and cans used especially in restaurants, bars, picnics, superstores and parties or social gatherings and use reusable utensils. We can also take a reusable water bottle instead of drinking bottled water. We can replace plastic bags, water bottles and utensils with reusable shopping bags and earthenware utensils. 

The future generations should be informed of the damage that has already been done and educated on how to tackle the situation to save this planet from future disasters.

We have only one earth. We are running out of time to save our planet. But by working together and sharing knowledge, progress can be accelerated. Each one of us can make a difference by adopting a sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle. Each individual action will contribute to a greater collective difference in saving Mother Earth.

Let‚Äôs celebrate International Mother Earth Day by beginning our life anew: better, kinder and enlightened in our attitudes towards our fellow human beings, our surroundings and Mother Nature.

Mother Earth nourishes us in her womb. It‚Äôs our responsibility to nurture her for our own sake and the future generations to come.

Let‚Äôs take action to save nature for a safer, beautiful future.

As the conflict between Iran and Israel intensifies, India has kicked off the seven phases of its national election. Following Narendra Modi's second consecutive term as prime minister, it is anticipated that he may be winning a rare third term, marking the end of a decade in power and the start of another era.

This period included significant events like hosting the G-20 conference in New Delhi, which underscored India's enhanced role in international affairs. India has consistently acted as a ‚Äònon-aligned‚Äô factor in global conflicts, from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the recent Israel-Hamas war. However, the election raises questions about the future direction of India‚Äôs foreign policy. How will the outcome of the election influence India's approach to international diplomacy, especially if there is a change in government?

INDIA: THE US'S ONLY 'DEMOCRATIC PARTNER' IN THE REGION?

In the international arena, where Western values often promote democracy in contrast to authoritarianism, the US and its allies have been actively contesting the systems under which Russia and China are ruled.

As these dynamics unfold, India emerges as a decisive player in Asia, being the largest democracy in the world. Since becoming prime minister in 2014, Narendra Modi has visited the US five times, the last in June 2023 when both countries reiterated that their friendship is based on democratic values.

However, India‚Äôs role and foreign policy manoeuvres within the region do not complicate the straightforward narrative of democracy versus authoritarianism. While the US and its Western allies decry the actions of Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin and China‚Äôs Xi Jinping as authoritarian and antithetical to democracy, India promotes a different story with its institutional democratic ideals. Positioned strategically between the great powers of China and Russia, India intensifies its role in the region with democratic values. Yet, it also navigates complex relationships with these countries, as seen when India continued to import oil from Russia despite the Ukraine war. This move aligned with China's stance towards Russia during the conflict, while the India-China border dispute remains on the table.

This multi-dimensional approach underscores the challenges and complexities of upholding democratic values in foreign policy, particularly in a region dominated by powerful neighbours with differing political systems. The US, while promoting democratic ideals globally, observes India‚Äôs balancing act, which involves engaging with so-called authoritarian regimes while maintaining its own democratic identity. This dynamic presents an ongoing challenge for US foreign policy in advocating for democratic governance while addressing the realpolitik considerations of its allies and partners in strategic regions like South Asia; India has always been a strategic partner.





S JAISHANKAR VS THE REST

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar could be the most influential maker of India‚Äôs foreign policy. He has served as the foreign secretary and the ambassador of India to the United States. His vision of India's foreign policy, as outlined in his book ""The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World,"" emphasises the strategic approach deeply rooted in historical and cultural narratives, particularly drawing from the Mahabharata. Jaishankar portrays India in the image of the Pandavas, suggesting a stance of ethical righteousness and strategic patience. This approach informs India‚Äôs moral positioning in global affairs and supports its active engagement in international diplomacy. Under his guidance, India has adopted a policy of strategic autonomy, engaging with all global powers while aligning closely with none, which is evident in India‚Äôs balanced relations amid global conflicts such as the ongoing tensions between Russia and Western nations.

Jaishankar advocates for proactive participation rather than passive observation, a policy reflected in India hosting significant international summits like the G-20. Moreover, Jaishankar‚Äôs policy extends to economic diplomacy, where India leverages its growing economic influence to bolster its geopolitical standing and enhance trade relations and foreign investments. According to Reuters, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is expected to meet Modi and announce a $2-3 billion investment in India.





GLOBAL CONFLICTS AND THE ELECTION

Historically, global crises and escalations have not prominently featured on the agenda of Indian electoral politics. However, it plays a role in criticising neighbouring China and Pakistan. This narrative has been changed under the leadership of Jaishankar, marking what could be called the Jaishankarian era of diplomacy. During his term, Jaishankar has asserted India‚Äôs role in the region, navigating the country beyond numerous domestic crises, including unemployment and societal issues related to religion and caste. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jaishankar directly claimed it did not matter who fought against whom, but India needs to look after the Indian people while buying Russian oil at a discount rather than condemning the war. But it has always shown a bold stand for de-escalating all conflicts.

In response to the recent tensions in the Middle East, Jaishankar warned that this could lead to another hike in oil prices and urged de-escalation. In the current geopolitical landscape marked by conflicts such as those between Israel and Iran, Jaishankar's approach has led India to navigate these complex dynamics carefully, advocating de-escalation and maintaining a balanced relationship with major global powers. This strategy of moral diplomacy does not only enhance its international image but also aligns with its internal ethos of being a force for global good. Jaishankar's blueprint for India‚Äôs foreign policy combines cultural wisdom with strategic imperatives, aiming to elevate India‚Äôs stature on the world stage while adhering to a path of strategic autonomy and ethical diplomacy. The rhetoric of India‚Äôs engagement in multilateral forums such as BRICS, G-20, and the Quad further underscores its strategic reorientation.

 Oil funds turn bullish as Mideast conflict intensifies ,"
                        
                        
                        

Portfolio investors are increasingly bullish about oil as Saudi Arabia and its OPEC‚Å∫ allies restrict production in the face of rising demand and the shadow war between Israel and Iran spills into the open.





Hedge funds and other money managers purchased the equivalent of 37 million barrels in the six most important petroleum-related futures and options contracts over the seven days ending on April 2.

Funds have been purchasers in 10 of the last 16 weeks, buying the equivalent of 446 million barrels since the middle of December, according to reports filed with exchanges and regulators.

As a result, the combined position has soared to 653 million barrels (63rd percentile for all weeks since 2013) from a record low of 207 million on Dec 12.

Funds have already become bullish about Brent, with a net position of 300 million barrels (69th percentile) and bullish long positions outnumbering bearish shorts by a ratio of 5.27:1 (62nd percentile).

There is more caution about the outlook for US crude prices given continued output growth from shale, with a net position of 208 million barrels (38th percentile) and a long-short ratio of 3.93:1 (48th percentile).

Even in US crude, however, the combined position in NYMEX and ICE WTI has surged from a record low of 31 million barrels on Dec. 12.

Saudi Arabia and its OPEC‚Å∫ allies have extended their production cuts until the end of the second quarter, lifting Brent prices to their highest for more than five months.

Brent‚Äôs six-month calendar spread has moved into a backwardation of more than $5 per barrel (96th percentile for all trading days since 2000) from a contango of 70 cents (37th percentile) on Dec. 13.

Economic data shows renewed growth in manufacturing across the United States, China and even in Europe, which will boost consumption of middle distillates such as diesel and gas oil.

At the same time, the undeclared conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified after Israeli warplanes last week attacked an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus killing several officers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Iran‚Äôs threat to retaliate has increased the probability of an escalation that could disrupt oil production facilities and tanker routes around the Persian Gulf, boosting prices and spreads.





US NATURAL GAS

Investors made few changes to gas positions for the fourth week running, after an earlier buying surge in late February and the start of March occasioned by the announcement of production and drilling cuts fizzled out.

Hedge funds and other money managers trimmed their net short position to 332 billion cubic feet (24th percentile for all weeks since 2010) on April 2 from 1,675 bcf (3rd percentile) on Feb. 20.

Working gas stocks were 629 bcf (+39% or +1.36 standard deviations) above the prior ten-year average on March 29 up from a surplus of just 64 bcf (+2% or +0.24 standard deviations) at the start of winter on Oct. 1.

Gas drilling activity has started to decelerate after futures prices fell to the lowest levels in real terms for more than three decades in February and March.

The number of rigs drilling primarily for gas had fallen to just 110 on April 5 down from 121 seven weeks earlier and the lowest for more than two years.

Reduced drilling should reduce production rates towards the end of the year and help rebalance the market, but it will take time to erode the enormous overhang of inventories inherited from the mild winter of 2023/24.

After trying and failing to identify a turning point three times over the last 12 months, fund managers have become cautious about the timing of any sustained price recovery.

 Western armed forces face recruitment crisis as threats mount ,"
                        
                        
                        

Every morning on the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, an unsuspecting crew member is called to the bridge, presented with a cookie and asked to sit in the captain‚Äôs chair.





Providing they are willing, their photograph is then shared with the world on social media while Captain Chris ""Chowdah"" Hill praises his young ""warriors"", many barely out of their teens and performing unglamorous, time-consuming tasks fixing machinery and planes.

‚ÄúIf I'm going to create morale, I need to make sure that everyone feels loved and valued,"" Hill told the US forces newspaper Stars and Stripes. ""I need to make sure everybody has a mission of purpose.""

On Nov. 4, less than a month after the Hamas assault on Israel from Gaza, the Eisenhower passed south through Egypt‚Äôs Suez Canal to take up position in the Red Sea. The carrier, her task force and its 7,000 US service personnel have been there ever since, since January conducting frequent air strikes in Yemen as well as supporting operations to protect civilian shipping.

Maintaining morale is becoming increasingly important. Like many other militaries around the world, the US Navy and Army in particular are in the middle of a battle for sufficient personnel.

In Ukraine‚Äôs push-back against Russia‚Äôs invasion, recruiting enough troops is now proving as important as sourcing artillery shells and drones. For the Pentagon, not having enough people could leave it unable to resource current operations, let alone scale up for future crises such as a face-off with the Kremlin, Beijing, Iran or North Korea.

The US Navy admitted in February it had only managed to recruit around 65% of the sailors it needed in the last months of 2023, while the US Army met only 74% of its target. In total, the US military fell more than 41,000 short of its enlistment goal in 2023, citing low civilian unemployment, declining interest in military careers, a national obesity ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù and technical problems slowing access to health records.

According to the Pentagon, roughly one in four people in the United States aged between 17 and 24 met the physical and educational requirements for military service, prompting the US Navy to become the first service to announce it would take recruits without a high school diploma.

Some parts of the US military are having e harder time than others.

According to official figures, the US Air and Space Forces ‚Äì which both prioritise highly skilled applicants and are inevitably often less physically gruelling ‚Äì met their 2023 recruitment targets, despite suggestions earlier in the year that the Air Force might miss.

More broadly, however, the military recruitment crisis appears global, at least across the Western world. Over the last year, military officials in Australia, Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Britain have all publicly expressed concern over a lack of volunteers.





In Europe, the mounting human cost of fighting in Ukraine has left multiple nations in mainland Europe openly considering conscription, at least in times of crisis. Other mitigation strategies include recruiting foreigners ‚Äì suggested in both Germany and Australia ‚Äì as well as a greater reliance on drones and unmanned systems.

Australia‚Äôs most recent defence review included the purchase of several ships capable of robot operations described as ‚Äúoptionally crewed‚Äù ‚Äì the first nation to describe warships that way, but unlikely to be the last.

For the US Army and Navy, recruitment troubles have prompted a heightened focus on keeping the personnel that they already have, particularly those with skills such as nuclear engineering that are hard to replace.

Those efforts have been rather more successful ‚Äì at least in the United States. Last year, the US Army met its 2023 full year goal for retaining 56,000 personnel whose contracts were up for renewal by the end of June. The US Navy also exceeded its targets for personnel renewing contracts.

European militaries, in contrast, appear to be seeing an epidemic of soldiers, sailors and aviators quitting earlier than expected. In France, officials say the average length of a military career is now a year shorter than it once was. In Britain, official figures show only five people joining the army for every eight that leave.

As NATO pours troops into eastern and central Europe and the United States and regional allies prepare for a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan as soon as 2027, strains may well get worse. An investigation by the US newspaper the Army Times discovered US Army tank units ‚Äì which worked a particularly punishing schedule supporting deployments to Europe and the Middle East ‚Äì had a suicide rate of twice the army average, seen in part a consequence of overwork.

While the back-to-back deployments of the Iraqi and Afghan wars brought their own challenges, the less bloody but still high-tempo challenges of the 2020s can be at least as punishing on morale.

Problems often come in waves ‚Äì the carrier USS George Washington suffered 11 suicides while docked in Norfolk Virginia for maintenance for over a year, linked in part to frustrations over poor accommodation and conditions.

If US fears about rising tensions with China, Russia and North Korea are right, the pressure on personnel may only increase. Unmanned systems and better leadership may fill some of the gap, but one of the challenges for the United States and its allies is to avoid a situation where their military personnel are already exhausted before any real fight actually starts.

" US manufacturers emerge from slump, set to boost fuel use ","
                        
                        
                        

US manufacturers have finally pulled out of the long, shallow slump that started in the middle of 2022, which will support petroleum consumption especially for diesel and other middle distillates in the months ahead.





The Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector climbed to 50.3 in March (34th percentile for all months since 1980) up from 47.8 (18th percentile) in February.

For the first time in 17 months, the index rose above the 50-point threshold dividing expanding activity from a contraction, putting an end to an unusually prolonged but shallow cyclical downturn.

The production sub-index surged to 54.6 (45th percentile) up from 48.4 (15th percentile) in February and was at its highest level since May 2022.

New orders were also positive at 51.4 (27th percentile) signalling the expansion should have momentum in the near term.

The manufacturing sector seems to have passed the worst of the downturn in the middle of last year and displays early signs of recovering.

In contrast, the much-larger services sector, which has also been much more resilient, showed an unexpected deceleration, after a strong expansion earlier in the year.

The purchasing index for the services sector, including real estate, construction, mining and farming, slipped to 51.4 (14th percentile) in March from 52.6 (20th percentile) in February and 53.4 (27th percentile) in January.

Overall, however, the US economy continued to expand last month, with a greater balance between manufacturing and services.

Reflecting the increase in business activity as well as employment gains and persistent inflation, traders have pared back their expectation for a reduction in interest rates later this year.

Futures prices show a roughly equal chance the central bank will cut overnight interest rates two or three times by a total of 50 basis points or 75 basis points by the end of 2024.

Three months ago, the central bank was expected to cut rates as much as six or seven times by a total of 150 or 175 basis points.

FUEL CONSUMPTION

Stronger manufacturing and the associated increase in freight are likely to boost petroleum consumption especially for diesel and similar middle distillate fuel oils.

More than three-quarters of distillate fuel oil is used for freight transport and manufacturing, so fuel consumption normally tracks changes in the business cycle measured by the manufacturing index fairly closely.

Distillate consumption was down by around 2% in the three months from November to January compared with the same period a year earlier.

But the winter was unusually mild, cutting consumption of distillate heating oil, and growing use of biodiesel and renewable diesel has been nibbling away at the market for petroleum-derived distillates.

Even if biodiesel and renewable diesel are taken into account, total distillate consumption was essentially flat in the November-January period compared with a year ago.

However, if the manufacturing recovery proceeds, distillate consumption should start to rise through the rest of 2024.





DISTILLATE INVENTORIES

Stocks of distillates were 13 million barrels (-9% or -0.73 standard deviations) below the prior 10-year seasonal average at the end of January, according to the latest monthly data from the Energy Information Administration.

Since then the deficit has remained broadly stable with inventories 15 million barrels (-11% or -0.90 standard deviations) below the 10-year average at the end of the week finishing on March 29.

Drone and missile attacks on tankers in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have led to extensive re-routing of distillate trade between North America, Europe and Asia, in most cases resulting in longer voyages.

But there has been little or no impact on the actual availability of distillates in the United States, confounding expectations stocks would tighten and prices would rise.

Futures prices for ultra-low sulphur diesel delivered in May 2024 are trading around $30 per barrel over US crude oil delivered in the same month, but the premium or crack spread has narrowed from $40 in early February.

The crack spread has fallen to its narrowest since before Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a sign supply is comfortable for the moment.

Hedge funds and other money managers have sold the equivalent of 23 million barrels of US diesel over the six weeks since the middle of February.

The fund community has moved from a fairly bullish position on diesel in the middle of February to a mildly bearish one by the end of March.

Fund sales have likely anticipated, accelerated and amplified the weakening of distillate prices relative to crude causing the crack spread to narrow.

OUTLOOK FOR 2024

Distillate inventories have not fallen as rapidly as anticipated earlier in the year as the market has adapted to the disruption of tanker routes.

But inventories display a strong cyclical component so the manufacturing recovery is likely to lead to a further depletion of inventories and put upward pressure on spreads and prices later in 2024.

Ukraine's drone attacks on Russia's refineries could also diminish global supplies later in the year because Russia is a major diesel exporter.

The relatively low level of diesel inventories means there is little cyclical slack inherited from the downturn in 2022/23.

Renewed consumption growth in 2024/25 is likely to tighten fuel supplies quickly and lead to early upward pressure on prices.

Together with a tight labour market, the limited spare capacity in diesel and other energy markets is one reason central banks are forced to be cautious in cutting interest rates.

 Echoes of silence: unveiling the Bangladesh genocide ,"
                        
                        
                        

Mar 25 holds a profound significance for Bangladesh, marking a solemn day of remembrance ingrained in the nation's collective consciousness, recalling harrowing experiences etched in history. Since 2017, Bangladesh has solemnly observed this day as National Genocide Day, a poignant acknowledgement of the atrocities inflicted upon its populace during one of its darkest epochs. The origins of this day trace back to the grim events of Mar 25, 1971, when the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight, a ruthless crackdown on the Bengali nationalist movement, unleashing a wave of violence, mass killings, and systematic atrocities to quash the independence aspirations of East Pakistan, known today as Bangladesh. This ruthless campaign left a trail of devastation, claiming countless innocent lives and tearing apart the fabric of Bengali society.

In recognition of this profound tragedy and the unwavering resilience of the Bangladeshi people, the government designated Mar 25 as National Genocide Day. The observance of this solemn occasion encompasses a myriad of activities and ceremonies, aimed at honouring the memory of the victims, educating future generations, and reaffirming the nation's steadfast commitment to upholding human rights. Central to the commemoration is the solemn homage paid to the martyrs who made the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of independence. Across the nation, memorial services are held, where individuals gather to offer prayers, lay wreaths, and illuminate candles in remembrance of the fallen heroes, serving as poignant reminders of the sacrifices made in pursuit of freedom.

The significance of National Genocide Day extends beyond mere remembrance, serving as a catalyst for fostering national unity and raising awareness about the imperative of human rights. Moreover, it provides a crucial platform for educating the youth about the profound impact of the Liberation War and the enduring importance of safeguarding democratic principles and justice. Through seminars, discussions, and exhibitions organised by educational institutions and cultural bodies, the memory of the genocide is preserved, ensuring that future generations grasp the value of freedom and the imperative of resisting oppression.

In addition to its commemorative aspects, National Genocide Day serves as a forum for global advocacy against genocide and human rights violations. Having endured the horrors of genocide firsthand, Bangladesh emerges as a vocal advocate for international peace and justice. On this solemn day, the government and the citizens of Bangladesh reaffirm its unwavering commitment to combatting genocide, fostering reconciliation, and pursuing accountability for past atrocities, leveraging diplomatic channels and participation in global forums to amplify its voice for the oppressed.





However, while Bangladesh commemorates its tragedy, the international community's response has often fallen short. For many around the world, Mar 25 may hold little significance, overshadowed by competing global events. Yet, the events of 1971 in Bangladesh were not mere political conflicts but systematic acts of genocide, leaving behind a scarred nation and a silenced narrative. Amidst reflections on the past, it becomes imperative to acknowledge the complicity of certain nations and institutions in perpetuating the suffering of the Bangladeshi people, confronting uncomfortable truths to pave the path for healing and justice.

As we reflect on the past, it's crucial to acknowledge the complicity of certain nations and institutions in perpetuating the suffering of our people. During a time of great turmoil, the US openly aligned with Pakistan, the perpetrator state, thereby prolonging the agony endured by the Bangladeshi populace. The Bangladesh genocide stands as a stark reminder of the international community's failure to intervene in the face of mass atrocities. Despite overwhelming evidence of systematic violence, including mass killings and rape, the UN refrained from officially recognising the plight of the Bangladeshi people as genocide.

Between December 2021 and April 2023, through my advocacy efforts, three prominent international organisations ‚Äì the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention (LIGP), Genocide Watch (GW), and the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) ‚Äì formally acknowledged the egregious crimes committed in Bangladesh as genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Additionally, facilitated by the Liberation War Museum of Bangladesh, the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience issued a formal declaration acknowledging the genocide in Bangladesh. The recent recognition of Bangladesh's genocide by these institutions underscores the urgency of addressing this issue.

It is time for the United States to confront its past actions, reckon with their consequences, and extend a long-overdue apology to the people of Bangladesh. Just as President Joe Biden's administration acknowledged the Armenian genocide, America must also acknowledge its role in the atrocities perpetrated against the Bengali population. For far too long, the voices of the victims have been silenced, and their suffering relegated to the margins of history. As citizens of a nation founded on principles of justice and equality, it's incumbent upon us to stand in solidarity with those denied the rights and freedoms we cherish.

Again, only through acknowledgement and recognition can we begin to heal the wounds of the past and pave the way for a more just and equitable future. We urge the United Nations to acknowledge its past inaction during the Bangladesh genocide and to take concrete steps to address this historical injustice. The UN Genocide Prevention Desk must incorporate the Bangladesh genocide as a case study, alongside other well-documented atrocities, to enhance education and awareness.





Additionally, we appeal to European nations to formally recognise the Bangladesh genocide. As we commemorate 53 years since the tragic events of 1971, the absence of official acknowledgement from these countries remains glaring. By recognising the atrocities committed against the Bangladeshi people, European nations can reaffirm their commitment to truth, justice, and human rights, standing in solidarity with victims and survivors while advocating for accountability and remembrance.

We implore the perpetrator state, Pakistan, to confront the dark chapter of history and acknowledge its role in the 1971 genocide. The truth of the atrocities inflicted upon the people of Bangladesh cannot be denied or overlooked. Pakistan must take responsibility for the grave injustices perpetrated against innocent lives during that period. Furthermore, we call upon Pakistan to demonstrate genuine dedication to justice by fully cooperating in the pursuit and trial of those individuals still alive who bear responsibility for orchestrating and executing these heinous crimes.

By demanding an apology and recognition from the countries and entities, we are not seeking to assign blame or revisit old grievances. Instead, we aim to honour the memory of those who perished and give voice to the countless victims whose stories have been silenced by time. We must confront the uncomfortable truths of our history and strive for a world where such atrocities are never allowed to happen again.

Also, we call on the United Nations to acknowledge its past inaction during the Bangladesh genocide and take steps to address this historical injustice. It's time for the UN Genocide Prevention Desk to include the Bangladesh genocide as a case study, alongside other well-known atrocities, to educate and raise awareness.

 China's hydro generators wait for the rains to come ,"
                        
                        
                        

China's hydro generation has been essentially flat for the last three years, despite commissioning several large new power plants, as a prolonged drought has sharply reduced river flows in the southwestern part of the country.

Since the drought started in the middle of 2022, China has been forced to turn back to coal to meet electricity consumption, while wind and solar have helped meet some of the growth in demand.

Installed hydro capacity had climbed 18% to 422 million kilowatts (kW) by the end of 2023 from 358 million kW at the end of 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).

But the amount of hydro electricity generated fell 1% to 1,141 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2023 from 1,153 billion kWh fours years earlier (""Output of energy products"", NBS, March 2024).

Based on the previous trend, drought cut generation by about 190 billion kWh (-14%) in 2023 compared with what it might have been under normal river conditions based on capacity additions.

SOUTHWEST CHINA

Most of the country's hydro generation comes from a string of massive cascade dams and power stations situated on the Yangtze and its tributaries, which drain the Tibetan plateau and other parts of the southwest.

The neighbouring provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan alone accounted for 48% of the country's total hydroelectric generation in 2020.

If the downstream province of Hubei, home to the giant Three Gorges Dam, is included, the generation share reaches 60%.

Other southwestern areas drained by the Yangtze and smaller rivers, including Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong and Chongqing, take the share to 75%.

Southwest China receives most of its annual precipitation between June and August during the East Asian Monsoon, with a smaller amount between March and May during the spring rains, while autumn and winter are very dry.

Since the middle of 2022, however, much of the region has been gripped by a drought that has sharply reduced river flows.

In most of Tibet and parts of Sichuan and Yunnan, rainfall has been 50% or more below average since the middle of 2022.

The city of Yibin, located on the border between Sichuan and Yunnan, received just 663 millimetres (26 inches) of rain in 2023 and 1,024 millimetres in 2022 compared with an average of 1,225 millimetres per year between 2014 and 2021.





LOWER RIVER FLOWS

China collects extensive data on rainfall, river flows and the volume of water impounded behind the country's hydroelectric and irrigation dams.

Multiple national and provincial government agencies are involved, but the data is notoriously difficult to access in real time, or even at all (""Making China's water data accessible, usable and sharable,"" Lin et al, 2023).

However, some indication of the drought's early impact can be gauged from the China Statistical Yearbook published by the NBS.

Nationwide surface water resources were assessed as 2.60 trillion cubic metres in 2022, the latest year for which data is currently available.

Surface resources were 7% below the 10-year average for 2012-2021 and the lowest for any year since the severe drought of 2011. The current drought has likely cut surface resources even further in 2023.

Moreover, the surface water data is for the country as a whole, and the deficit in southwest China is almost certainly far more severe.

Tibet's surface resources had fallen by 10% in 2022 compared with the flood-hit year of 2020, while Sichuan's were down 32%.





TURNING TO COAL

China's electricity consumption has surged after the country lifted social distancing controls and emerged from the exit wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2023.

Wind generation increased by 122 billion kWh (+18%) while solar generation rose by 65 billion kWh (+28%) in 2023.

But with hydro output down 61 billion kWh (-5%), the country increased thermal generation by 379 billion kWh (+6%) to meet growing demand.

Most of the extra thermal generation was from coal-fired units, though small quantities also came from gas-fired power plants, especially in Guangdong and the southern province of Hainan.

Many coal-fired generators act as reliability reserve units to meet daily and seasonal demand peaks as well as back up in case of variations in river flows and hydro generation.

The drought likely cut hydro generation by around 190 billion kWh in 2023, but this is also an indicator of how much extra hydro could be generated when river flows return to normal.

It also gives an idea of how much mostly coal-fired thermal generation could be avoided when the drought ends and rainfall returns to more normal levels.

WAITING FOR RAIN

Southwest China is coming to the end of the dry season and waiting for the arrival of the spring rains and the main summer monsoon. River levels remain low.

As a result, thermal generation was up 104 billion kWh (+11%) in the first two months of 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. In contrast, hydro generation was up by just 2 billion kWh (+2%).

If the drought continues for a third consecutive summer, hydro generation will remain depressed and the country will have no choice but to ramp up coal firing again this year.

If the drought ends, however, the combination of a surge in hydro generation with the rapid deployment of wind and solar capacity will produce a sharp slowdown in coal-fired growth and perhaps even a slight decline in 2024.

 Secrets to live a happy life ,"
                        
                        
                        

In human beings, the pursuit of happiness is inbuilt. Happiness is a prerequisite for our overall well-being.

People often ask me ‚ÄòHow can you be so happy all the time?

The answer is simple, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a matter of choice to be happy or to worry about everything that goes wrong in life.‚Äô

Worrying cannot change anything rather it worsens the situation. I admit that it‚Äôs difficult to stop worrying but we can always try.

Worrying is normal and that‚Äôs what makes us human.

But I choose to be happy and try.

Though happiness can have many different definitions, it may be described as an emotional state involving positive emotions characterised by feelings of contentment.

Happiness may seem a fleeting emotion but it‚Äôs within your reach. You have to choose consciously to be happy every single day. Determination and a few simple changes in your thought process and lifestyle can make life overflow with happiness.




To be happy is a choice you make every day, every hour and refining and renewing that state is a constant pursuit
Julia Roberts





A few simple strategies can help you to lead a happy life.

A genuine smile causes the brain to release dopamine, endorphins and serotonin. These lower anxieties increase feelings of happiness and well-being.

One of my daily habits is looking at the mirror just after waking up every morning, smiling and saying, ‚ÄòYes, I am happy‚Äô. Believe me, it works.‚Äô Try it and you will see the difference.

Greet and smile at people, even strangers. Their happy faces will result in feelings of happiness flowing through you.

Practising gratitude has a great impact on feelings of hope and happiness. Start your day by being grateful for anything that comes to your mind: Be thankful for being alive and express your gratitude to everyone who loves you and has done anything for you. Thank your Creator for having given you so much- the home, the food, the luxuries and above all this life.

Immerse yourself with positive energy. Look for all the beautiful things around you.

There are ups and downs in life - stop worrying. Constantly worrying creates anxiety about things that you can‚Äôt normally control. Supposing something bad happens to you. Think, ‚ÄòSomething worse could have happened,‚Äô or ‚ÄòMaybe some better things are coming my way.‚Äô Believe me, the universe listens to positive thoughts.

Train your brain to banish toxic negative thoughts and nurture positivity Spend some time looking at the positives in your life every day. Your brain will start doing it automatically.

Be happy about your accomplishments. Take a moment to celebrate yourself every day. Doing so is a reminder that life is not only about suffering and hardships. This will increase your optimism and boost greater happiness.

Be kind to yourself. Many of us strive for perfection. No one is perfect, nor is life. Notice the beauty and grace in those imperfections. Rather than thinking of the failures and mistakes, focus on the positive things life has bestowed upon you.

Give sincere compliments to people, whenever you can. It‚Äôs an easy way to brighten someone‚Äôs day. It has a ripple effect-you will be surprised how happy you feel.

Several studies have found that generous people are happier compared to selfish people. Self-interest is natural. Focus on other people‚Äôs well-being too. Share your blessings. Be generous with your time and money. Give to those in need.

Meditate every day to improve focus. Through Mindful meditation, you will find peace and affirmation. Deep breathing exercises are also a form of meditation. Studies show that we experience feelings of contentment, and empathy right after meditation. It‚Äôs often been proven to be the single most effective way to live a permanently happier life.

Listen to music. It uplifts the spirit by causing the brain to release dopamine, generating high levels of happiness.

Live according to your personal values, core beliefs and goals. Then, align your lifestyle with those for an abundance of happiness.

People change. Reevaluate your goals. Let go of those goals that no longer attract you. Focus on building a career accordingly. It will keep you motivated and happy.

One of the best things to boost your happiness is to be yourself. Don‚Äôt depend on the approval of others; accept yourself for who you are.

Humans are social beings. Research shows that social relationships have a positive benefit on your mental health. One secret to happiness is surrounding yourself with happy and positive-minded people. Regularly connect with good friends. Share and celebrate the good things in your lives with an open mind. Even something as simple as texting, emailing or calling a friend can open doors of mutual good relationships and happiness.





Studies suggest that the happiest people are the ones who have a balance in relationships with a romantic partner, friends, family and colleagues. Healthy relationships hold the key to happiness and delay mental and physical degeneration

Interact with people you see regularly. Talk to people you see- the liftman, the caretaker, the tea boy, the delivery man; people who take the same transport with you every day. Maintain good relationships with your neighbours. These interactions are crucial for boosting your happiness.

A simple way to lead a happy life is to be honest. Lying and hiding things can generate a sense of guilt leading to stress.

It's important to have some free time. Get involved in activities that make you happy like going to the movies, restaurants or going travelling. Just having a conversation with friends will also make you feel rejuvenated.

Keep learning new things that you like; engage in creative activities. Personal growth and creative actions foster a sense of fulfilment and long-term happiness.

Spend time in nature. If possible walk barefoot- touch the grass and trees. Sit and feel the air, the fragrance of earth and listen to the sounds of birds. Studies have proven that spending just 120 minutes in nature a week could benefit your mental health and well-being.

Sleep at least 7 to 8 hours for good health, brain function, and emotional well-being. Make your bedroom comfortable and tidy it up in the morning; so that when you return you have a warm cosy haven to laze around.

Have a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle for a healthy mind and body.

Regular exercises help reduce stress, depression and feelings of anxiety and boost happiness. Even a small amount of physical activity can make a difference. Walking or swaying with music for 10-20 minutes can do the trick.

Journaling also helps. Write at least three good things every day in a diary. Studies show that the simple act of listing increases happiness.

The age of social media has made it difficult not to compare yourself to others. Stop comparing! Each life is different. Be thankful for what you have and try to develop new skills to help grow further.

Studies show that happiness doesn‚Äôt come from material possessions or money. We sacrifice time, money and energy for material gain. In the process, we neglect ourselves and our loved ones which leads to heartaches, not happiness. Nurture relationships.

Sometimes in our lives, we may lose some loved ones; lose a job or suffer from illness. Remember it's part of life. Acknowledge the unhappy feelings. Later, shift your focus towards positive thoughts and develop the resilience to cope.

Gossip and negative talk bar happiness. Let go of these and any hard feelings and jealousy towards anyone for inner peace.

These simple yet important strategies can help you build inner resilience and boost happiness.

The UN General Assembly declared 20 March as the International Day of Happiness. It was first celebrated on March 20, 2013. It‚Äôs observed every year to make people aware of the importance of happiness and well-being in the lives of human beings across the world.

The theme of 2024 is, ‚ÄòReconnecting for Happiness: Building Resilient Communities.‚Äô It aims to inspire everyone to spread positivity and encourage nations to prioritise the happiness of their citizens. The happiness of individuals and communities is directly linked to the prosperity of the world. It stands as a bridge for promoting sustainable development goals. Happiness nurtured worldwide will make, our world a better and happier place.

True Happiness can only be achieved by making others happy.

Give and share your love every day.

Smile and be happy!

The artificial intelligence boom has hit the crypto market with a bang.

Coins linked to AI-focused crypto projects have jumped alongside tech stocks like Nvidia, driven by insatiable investor appetite for applications like machine-learning.

The rise of many AI crypto tokens has outpaced even that of bitcoin over the past year as the world's biggest cryptocurrency has surged to record levels.





Their combined market value has ballooned to $26.4 billion, from just $2.7 billion last April, according to CoinGecko data. Tokens linked to these projects are up between 145 percent and 297 percent in the past 30 days.

If the more optimistic industry predictions come to pass, there could be more room to run, as some market watchers say crypto and blockchain technology could help solve some of the AI industry's teething problems such as privacy and a need for computing power.





""As both AI systems and blockchain networks continue to grow, we will see more and more use cases fusing together the two industries,"" said Markus Levin, co-founder of blockchain data storage firm XYO Network.

Trading volumes in AI tokens have also risen sharply this year, Kaiko Research data showed, hitting an all-time high of $3.8 billion in late February.

""There is a significant chance that ... AI applications will be crypto's raison d'√™tre,"" fund manager VanEck's Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush said in a note.

Some of the top blockchain projects at the moment include the Render Network, a blockchain platform for peer-to-peer sharing of AI-generated graphics, Fetch.AI, a platform to build AI apps and SingularityNET, an AI services marketplace.

AI-linked blockchain products include a wide variety of services including payments, trading models, machine-generated non-fungible tokens and blockchain-based marketplaces for AI applications where users pay developers in cryptocurrency.

VanEck pointed to the use of crypto tokens as rewards, developing physical computation infrastructure, data verification, and transparency in proving digital ownership as primary areas where blockchain technology lends real-world value to AI development.

Offering crypto tokens as incentives allows quick scalability, said io's Shadid. His company plans to launch a token later this year.

""The reason we can scale fast is because of the token we have coming out,"" he added. ""The token incentivizes owners of physical infrastructure to bring their computers on to our network,"" Shadid added.

Yet, just as with the AI boom itself, picking winners and losers could be fraught with peril.

""We're still in the very early stages of AI networks integrating with blockchain-based networks, and the utility of a lot of tokens is still very much uncertain,"" cautioned Levin.

 Flowers for solidarity ,"
                        
                        
                        Flowers - the word itself brings joy to all of us. It stirs our imaginations and creates a vivid visualisation of bright beautiful flowers swaying in the breeze. You can almost smell their fragrance. For centuries, flowers have been a powerful medium of communication, overflowing with hidden meanings and emotional symbolism. The tradition of employing flowers as symbols has its roots in ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian cultures. Egyptians used floral symbolism in their art and religion, the Greeks and Romans associated flowers with their gods and goddesses. The captivating power and timeless appeal of floral symbolism have also been skillfully interwoven as a literary device in literature for a long time. Authors from different periods and genres have enriched their stories using the exquisite beauty and varied meanings of flowers. The charm of flowers in Shakespeare's romantic sonnets; the soulful verses of Emily Dickinson and the euphoric description of Wordsworth have breezed through time and continue to inspire both readers and writers. Even now, Floral symbolism plays a significant role in literature, art and personal and public celebrations.The art of giving specific meanings to flowers, known as floriography, is fascinating. This fascinating language allows meaningful interpretation through different flowers and their colours; the number of flowers and floral arrangements.For example, the rose is the universal symbol of love and represents Aphrodite, the goddess of love. Depending on the colours, they have different meanings. Red roses symbolise passionate love and respect and yellow roses convey friendship and joy. Two roses symbolise mutual affection and love, six roses express infatuation.While the practice of floriography may not be as widespread today as it was during the Victorian age, the language of flowers continues to captivate us and inspire creativity. A flower‚Äôs appeal is in its contradictions ‚Äî so delicate in form yet strong in fragrance, so small in size yet big in beauty, so short in life yet long on effect.Terri GuillemetsFlowers and women complement each other in a similar way: delicate yet strong.A traditional way to celebrate International Women‚Äôs Day is by sending flowers to the women in your life to express your support.What flowers should we send?Before we delve into this, let‚Äôs talk about International Women's Day. It‚Äôs a global event held on March 8th each year to celebrate women's social, economic, cultural and political achievements; to honour women and their contributions to the family, society and the world; create awareness and take actions to dissolve gender disparity; focus on women's rights where education, reproductive rights and violence and abuse against women are addressed.International Women's Day, also known as IWD, had its seed in the labour movement in the US in 1908. About 15,000 women walked through the streets in New York City demanding shorter working hours, better wages and their right to vote. Later women in Soviet Russia brought out processions demanding their right to vote and this demand was accepted in 1917. It was later recognised as an annual event on Mar 8, 1975, by the United Nations.Each year, the UN observes the day with a particular issue and campaign theme for women's rights.This year, 2024, the theme is 'Invest in women: Accelerate progress‚Äô.According to the UN, since the 2020 COVID pandemic, conflicts have left millions of people in severe poverty. Conflicts and rising prices may lead 75 percent of countries to cut public spending by 2025, negatively affecting women and their essential services. If immediate action isn‚Äôt taken 342 million women and girls might be the victims of poverty by 2030.Gender equality is the greatest human rights challenge and can only be addressed by empowering women. To bring in change and accelerate the transition towards a healthier, safer, and more equal world, investment in women's sectors must become a top priority.According to the UN website data‚Ä¢ An additional $360 billion is needed per year to achieve gender equality.‚Ä¢ Closing gender gaps in employment could boost GDP per capita by 20 per cent.‚Ä¢ 300 million jobs created by 2030 by investing in care services‚Ä¢ Closing gaps in care and expanding services with decent jobs could spark almost 300 million jobs by 2035.Thus, governments must prioritise gender-responsive financing and increase public spending on essential services and social protection for women; develop and implement fair and transparent policies to protect women‚Äôs rights and ensure that women‚Äôs voices are heard in decision-making.We must also remember that Women‚Äôs rights are human rights. Women, in all their diversities, regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, age, sexual orientation, skin colour, health status, occupation, income and religion need to be celebrated.Inclusion is not a matter of political correctness. It is the key to growth.Jesse JacksonInvesting in women and championing gender equality will pave the way to a future where everyone in society will have countless possibilities, flourish and become empowered.The campaign theme of IWD, 2024 ‚ÄòInspire Inclusion‚Äô emphasises the crucial role of inclusion in achieving gender equality; encourages everyone to recognise contributions of women from all walks of life; calls for action to break down barriers and bias; helps their voices to be heard and creates environments where all women are valued and respected.IWD: we inspire others to understand and value women's inclusion, we forge a better world. And when women themselves are inspired to be included, there's a sense of belonging, relevance, and empowerment.Women can be empowered to overcome obstacles and achieve their full potential through education, awareness and advocacy campaigns and by providing them with equitable resources.IWD is a day to show solidarity with all the women in the world and has a logo. But in some parts of the world, it also has a floral symbol, the Mimosa. Though IWD was observed since the early 1900s in America and Europe, it wasn‚Äôt until March 8, 1946, that flowers began to be closely associated with this day.It originated in Italy. Though the first Women's Day in Italy was celebrated in 1922, it took on a particular meaning in 1945, when the Women's Union in Italy regained rights to vote lost under Mussolini‚Äôs Fascist regime. Three members of the Unione Donne Italiane (a women‚Äôs rights organisation) nominated the Mimosa flower as a symbol to represent IWD. Despite having delicate flowers, it grows even in the harshest conditions just like women. It was picked as a symbol of strength, sensitivity, and sensibility.Since then, the tradition of giving flowers on this day to express solidarity and honour women has continued. Although the mimosa flower has a special significance, there are many other flowers to choose from. Gifting roses on any occasion is always a great idea. It‚Äôs estimated that flower shops sell more than 150,000 roses on this day in shops across Russia alone. Roses, generally, spread the message of love and romance. But different colours of roses have their specific meanings. Since, the colour theme for the day is associated with purple signifying justice and dignity, giving purple roses and pink roses are an excellent choice to express admiration to the women in your life. Carnations are a great alternative. These flowers signify respect and friendship. White carnations represent luck, and pink carnations represent admiration and gratitude. Red carnations are also a popular pick.The lotus symbolises creation, rebirth, and the sun. The blue lotus signifies spiritual enlightenment and the white lotus symbolises purity.Lilies signify purity, beauty, passion and devotion. Also, according to the Greek myth lilies are associated with fertility, motherhood, and rebirth.Chrysanthemums or Tulips can be wonderful options. Chrysanthemums not only represent good fortune and happiness but also symbolises honour and compassion. Tulips symbolise love, rebirth, charity and respect.A combination of purple, green and white colour symbolises the equality of women which originated from the Women's Social and Political Union in the UK in 1908. Green symbolises hope and white purity. There's a new introduction of the yellow colour representing a 'new dawn'. It's commonly used to signify a second wave of feminism. Thus purple with green represents traditional feminism, purple with yellow represents progressive contemporary feminism. Pink, purple, green white, and green are the colours that are connected to the IWD celebration theme every year. To express your solidarity, a gift with the combination of flowers of these colours to the women you admire, can work as a driving force for them. Our collective efforts to take women forward will help them break the glass ceiling.As we celebrate International Women's Day 2024, let us reaffirm our commitment to creating a more equitable and inclusive society for women around the globe.Let's celebrate women's achievements; take action for equality, invest in their welfare and inspire inclusion.It starts from our households first, then the society, educational institutions, our workplaces and the world around us.Be the one to champion women's rights. Show your support by sending flowers to the special women in your life. [Tasneem Hossain is a multilingual poet, columnist, op-ed and fiction writer, translator, educator and training consultant.

" Despite a tough week, Germany is key to rearming Europe ","
                        
                        
                        

On Feb 27, the frigate Hessen became the first German warship since 1945 to fire in anger as it engaged three unidentified drones it believed posed an immediate threat to Red Sea shipping.

The first salvo of two SM-2 interceptor missiles missed as a fortunate consequence of what German officials later said was human error ‚Äì the first drone targeted, which the Germans said failed to transmit a standard identification signal, turned out to be a US MQ-9 Reaper operating separately to the US-led ""Prosperity Guardian"" shipping protection mission.

The next shots, however, successfully brought down two Iranian-made drones almost certainly operated by Houthi fighters in nearby Yemen who have wreaked havoc on international shipping routes in recent months.

Four days later, the Italian frigate Duilio brought down a similar unmanned aerial vehicle which officials said had approached the ship - all a reminder that Europe is being dragged ever deeper into a growing conflict that it is now racing to adapt to.

Last month, the European Union agreed to send its own task force to the Red Sea to protect shipping against drone missile strikes, a force that will work parallel to the US mission.

But it is the conflict in Ukraine, and the realisation that regardless of whether Donald Trump returns to the White House, the United States is refocusing on Asia and therefore less on Europe, that are truly forcing change.

The last few weeks have shown European leaders grappling with that new reality amid increasingly public rows over how the continent can best handle Ukraine, avoid catastrophic war and coordinate its own defence without always having to turn to the United States.

Since the founding of NATO in 1949, European nations have based their defence on a partnership with Washington ‚Äì and have often struggled to find common ground beyond that, with talk of a joint European army unravelling several times.





The last two weeks have seen another spike in often highly public disagreements, particularly between Berlin and Paris.

On the surface, arguments tend to be over specific policies or statements ‚Äì such as French President Emmanuel Macron‚Äôs suggestion European nations should not rule out sending combat troops to Ukraine, or whether Berlin should provide Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv.

More broadly, however, they represent a resumption of a long-predictable tussle for control of European defence policy between Germany and France, one that may determine how the continent is defended in the coming decades.

The mounting violence in the Red Sea is now clearly part of that growing challenge. So far, US Navy vessels ‚Äì alongside two British counterparts and one French warship ‚Äì have shot down the vast majority of incoming drones and missiles. But there are mounting concerns in Washington that this is exhausting US stockpiles.

Ultimately, most of the ships passing through the Red Sea are en route to Europe, and it appears inevitable European nations will need to step up their defence despite the mounting risk.

Ukraine, however, is now proving a much more dramatic driver. With US military supplies to Ukraine blocked in Congress, Kyiv is much more dependent on Europe for weapons to survive the coming year ‚Äì and is already complaining that EU nations managed to deliver fewer than a third of the million artillery shells they had promised by the end of March.





GERMANY FACES CRITICS

European leaders broadly agree that they must fix that problem fast. The last two weeks, however, have seen highly public rows on how to do so.

Macron‚Äôs suggestion of combat troops was roundly rejected by multiple Western nations, most particularly by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whom Macron had mocked for his attempts at the beginning of the war to limit German supplies to sleeping bags and helmets.

By most measures, Berlin has since then chalked out a slot as the leading military supporter of Ukraine in Europe, with think tank the Keil Institute reporting its contribution in the two years from January 2022 at 17.7 billion euros, more than twice Britain‚Äôs 7 billion pounds and much more than the 2.6 billion euros reported by France.

But Germany has been repeatedly pilloried for its initial reluctance to send each new tranche of arms, from Leopard tanks to its current refusal to send Taurus cruise missile

 Europe's mild winter leaves gas stocks at record high ,"
                        
                        
                        

Europe is on track to end the winter with a record volume of gas in storage, which has pushed futures prices back to pre-crisis levels once inflation is taken into account.

The supply picture has been transformed from two years ago, when traders and policymakers were worried about possible gas shortages following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

Storage facilities across the European Union and the United Kingdom were 62% full on Mar 5 compared with an average of 41 percent full on the same date between 2011 and 2020.

Inventories amounted to 707 terawatt-hours (TWh), which was 277 TWh (+64% or +2.14 standard deviations) above the prior ten-year seasonal average.

The surplus had swelled from 167 TWh (+18% or +1.70 standard deviations) at the start of the winter heating season on October 1.

Winter 2023/24 has mostly been characterised by a strong positive North Atlantic Oscillation, directing strong westerly winds from across the Atlantic into Northwest Europe.

Pressure differentials between the Greenland-Iceland low-pressure area and the Bermuda-Azores high-pressure area have been greater than normal, accelerating warm, moist air into Northwest Europe.

The result has been higher temperatures and wind speeds than average, reducing heating demand and at the same time boosting wind generation, creating a double cut to gas consumption.





So far this winter, heating demand has been 14% below the long-term average in London and 25% below the average at Frankfurt in Germany.

Inventories are on track to end winter around 664 TWh, setting a record and beating previous highs of 629 TWh at the end of winter 2022/23 and 609 TWh at the end of winter 2019/20.

Northwest Europe is about 80% through the heating season so any cold snaps are unlikely to make a significant difference to the outcome at this point.

It is the region's second mild winter in a row. Europe has been lucky as well as smart. 

High prices and government policies to reduce gas and electricity consumption have played a role averting shortages, but back-to-back mild winters have played a bigger role securing energy supplies.

Chartbook: Europe gas inventories and prices

Since October 2023, futures prices have declined steadily to encourage more consumption and limit accumulation of excess inventories.

Inflation-adjusted front-month futures prices fell to an average of just 26 euros ($28.40) per megawatt-hour in February down from 46 euros in October 2023 and a record 245 euros in August 2022.

Front-month prices have reverted close to the pre-crisis ten-year average between 2011 and 2020 of 23 euros in real terms.

Lower prices should eventually encourage energy-intensive manufacturing industries that idled plants in 2022 and 2023 to restart some of them.

Major industrial users mostly hedge gas purchases in the forward market, where year-ahead prices have fallen to an average of around 30-31 euros per megawatt-hour so far in 2024.





Year-ahead prices are not vastly higher than the pre-crisis average for 2011-2020 of 26 euros once adjusted for core inflation.

It will take longer for the decline in wholesale costs to filter through to retail prices for gas and electricity but households and small businesses should see prices decline before winter 2024/25.

Lower prices are already directing more liquefied natural gas cargoes to price-sensitive customers in East and South Asia that were unable or unwilling to compete with wealthier users in Europe during 2022/23.

Prices need to fall far enough for long enough to purge some excess inventory and make room in the storage system for the accumulation of inventories during the summer of 2024.

 Quality of services in mobile telecom: Challenges and way forward ,"
                        
                        
                        

While acknowledging 70 percent improvement in country-wide mobile internet speed over the last one year, OOKLA SpeedtestGlobal Index (1) released in Dec 2023 has ranked Bangladesh 101st in terms of speed. When we consider global Mobile Internet speed which has improved by 30 percent (2) throughout 2023, there is good reason to feel disappointed to find Bangladesh languishing at the 101st place in the table. So, how come even after outperforming the rest of the world by a long margin, we find ourselves at the bottom of the pile! Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into the ranking to get a better picture.





How did mobile internet speed improve by 70 percent in 2023 in Bangladesh?

Aggressive data network capacity expansion by MNOs over 2300/2600 MHz band all through 2023 was the main driver behind this phenomenal improvement in country-wide mobile internet speed. This was largely facilitated by the regulator when they allocated 190 MHz of spectrum in the mid bands to all four MNOs in the local market through an auction held in Mar 2022. On the other hand, the improvement in mobile internet speed observed in the rest of the world was largely driven by 5G penetration.

SPEED RANKING VS SPECTRUM HOLDINGS

When we carefully study the top 15 countries in the ranking, the first thing that stands out is the profile of spectrum holdings. In general, on average, each country has released approximately 1 GHz of spectrum in low and mid band range (3) from 8 different bands. Bangladesh, on the contrary, allocated 503 MHz of spectrum (equivalent unpaired) from 5 bands for Mobile services. In this connection, it is worth noting that the industry experts strongly recommend securing a minimum 1 GHz of spectrum in low/mid band to be able to give a taste of true Mobile Broadband.

Let‚Äôs change the perspective of the study by analysing the spectrum allocation profile of the countries having similar market size (taking population into consideration) to Bangladesh4. On average, each country has allocated approx. 800 MHz of spectrum from 8 bands. Average speed ranking for the study group is 60 (5). Therefore, it is abundantly clear that allocating sufficient spectrum and ensuring its optimum utilisation are the key factors to ensure reasonable mobile internet experience. However, it is important to acknowledge that an impactful spectrum allocation is a comprehensive process involving careful consideration of timing, amount, roadmap and above all pricing of the allocated spectrum.

It is recommended to release spectrum to the market as soon as there is a business case for the operators to use it. From an empirical study, a delay of two years to launch services resulted in 11 ‚Äì 16 percentage point lower (6) 4G population coverage (on average). Not just the limited coverage, limiting the supply of spectrum comes with great risk in terms of customer experience. On an average, every 20 MHz of additional spectrum results in 15 percent increase in download speed (7).

SPECTRUM PRICING

Spectrum Pricing:

According to the study by GSMA, the final spectrum prices in developing countries (Bangladesh included) were, on an average, more than three times those in developed countries, once the differences in income per capita are taken into account (8). In case of reserve prices, it was five times with similar modality. With regards to the reserve and final price following the auction process, it has been found that the ratio is higher in the developing countries, which is 0.8, compared to the 0.6 of developed countries (9). Higher ratio means the auction outcome was predominantly driven by reserve price. It is commonly observed that higher spectrum cost leads to negative customer experience in the form of slower data speed, substandard coverage and slowed down rollout by restricting MNO‚Äôs ability to further spend on network.

SPECTRUM ALLOCATION: BANGLADESH PERSPECTIVE

Bangladesh concluded three spectrum auctions for mobile services in 2018, 2021 and 2022. The auction held in Feb 2018 was the most significant one as it paved the way for the introduction of 4G licence with 2x25 MHz in 2100 band, 2x18 MHz in 1800 band and 2x3.4 MHz in 900 band on the auction table.

However, the reserve price of $30mn per MHz for 900/1800 band and $27 million per MHz for 2100 band considered by the market to be extremely high resulted in two thirds of the spectrum available for auction remaining unsold. When adjusted against GDP per capita, these prices were almost three times the Asia Pacific average final prices over 2000 ‚Äì 2017 (10).

In March 2021, Bangladesh launched an auction process to assign 2x7.4 MHz in 1800 band, 2x20 MHz in 2100 band. The last 2x5 MHz block from the 2100 band was finally sold for$46.75 million per MHz against the reserve price of $27 million. This clearly shows how competition over scarce available spectrum ends up taking the price to an abnormally high level. Finally, the last auction was held in Mar 2022 where two new bands ‚Äì 2300 and 2600 were introduced for the first time, 30 MHz spectrum remained unsold from the 2300 band.

GLOBAL BEST REGULATORY PRACTICES

There is unanimous agreement among the industry experts the world over that policymakers should prioritise improved and affordable mobile broadband services over state revenue maximisation when awarding spectrum. It is strongly recommended that reserve price is set at a modest level andallow the market to determine the final price.

In terms of what to avoid, limiting supply of spectrum should be avoided at any cost. Also, it really helps the industry to strategize its long-term investment plan for a country if the regulator publishes its long-term spectrum awarding plan well in advance (next 3- 5 years).

We cannot deny the fact that the MNOs are struggling with almost flat ARPU and average growth in industry. In this backdrop, deviation from best practices that leaves the spectrum price hiking unreasonably will further aggravate concerns on sustainability of the telecom business.

It should be noted that there is no single best practice to estimate the value of spectrum and the global benchmarks should be used with care. Nevertheless, this has become quite evident from global reference that at least 1 GHz of spectrum in low/mid bandshould be made available to the operators through a reasonable pricing model to ensure quality mobile internet experience and a respectable standing in the ranking table.

EFFICIENT USE OF SPECTRUM

Once the spectrum is released, it is important to have good management in place to ensure efficient utilisation of spectrum. In this connection, it‚Äôs worth noting that co-existence of proximity bands‚Äô operation is critical for customer experience.Moreover, in Bangladesh, there is a challenge to manage radio network quality and therefore customer experience due to the illegal use of licensed spectrum, (RF repeater, booster etc. installed by the customers themselves) especially in dense urban area.





CHALLENGES IN ACQUIRING SPACE FOR TELECOM TOWERS IN BANGLADESH

There are instances where customers live in areas that are not covered by the telecom network due to the absence of cell sites. Challenges in acquiring sites or finding a sustainable business case in remote areas are the major reasons in this regard. On many occasions, MNOs have found it difficult to secure sites for setting up telecom tower due to the prevalence of fear from EMF radiation in the society, which by the way has no scientific grounding as confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection or ICNIRP (11). The regulator together with stakeholders should work closely to address such fears among people through robust awareness campaigns by engaging the media and the academia.PROMOTING ACTIVE/PASSIVE INFRA SHARING

Setting up an in-building solution (IBS) to address indoor coverage in certain cases is a critical and probably the only available solution to strengthen the network. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that IBS is approx. five times more expensive but generate an insignificant amount of revenue compared to a regular site. In this backdrop, the regulator in collaboration with stakeholders should promote both passive/active infra sharing which could serve customer interest better.

Ensure reliable power supply:

Operation of mobile cell sites heavily depends on reliable commercial power. On an average, 60 percent of the total service interruption recorded by the MNOs is linked with power outage. Recently, some improvement in power management in urban areas has been observed. However, the situation in rural and remote areas is yet to catch up. As of now, quality of commercial power in approximately 30 percent of the area where MNOs are serving is not conducive to ensure quality mobile service (12). It is an irrefutable fact that unreliable commercial power supply severely impacts customer experience and creates stress on MNOs cost structure.  ROBUST FIBRE OPTIC NETWORK

Optical fibre is an integral part of the mobile network transmission system. On average, 20% - 25% of total service interruption is contributed by fibre. Since a significant portion of fibre is hanging overhead, it is exposed to all sorts of vulnerabilities. In addition, over the last few years, the fibre cut increased significantly because of massive civil works project undertaken by the Government. Considering the huge impact fibre optic cable network has on customer experience, the fibre service provider and the regulator should work closely with stakeholders to ensure robust fibre across the country. In addition, fibre cables should be declared as basic utility to ensure adequate protection during development works. 

CHANNELLING VOICE TRAFFIC THROUGH IP NETWORK It is very encouraging to observe that the basic performance indicator of voice services like accessibility, drop call and voice quality are gaining momentum. This is happening as legacy voice traffic (Circuit Switched voice over 2G/3G) is declining organically, which leaves the mobile operators in a better position to refarm spectrum for relatively efficient technologies and thereby optimise spectral load by channelling voice traffic through IP network (VoLTE). It is imperative that the Regulator together with the industry stakeholders devise suitable policy to encourage VoLTE capability in devices from the current 50 percent approximate rate. 

Conclusion:

Mobile telecom business encompasses an ecosystem that involves core network components, resources utilised, supporting infrastructure down to customer devices and many others. The concept of managing mobile service quality is thus versatile and complicated. Ensuring quality of services in line with the industry standard and customers‚Äô expectation is one of the core tasks in telecom business. 

However, it should be noted that there are many stakeholders other than the MNOs that contribute to the quality of services(QoS) experienced at the customers‚Äô end. Singling out MNOs for all shortcomings in QoS is grossly unfair. MNOs alone cannot ensure a fool-proof network. Policymakers, Regulatorand the entire set of stakeholders, including the ecosystem partners, have to join hands to make sure we have customers happy with the QoS they experience.

Let‚Äôs not be trapped by faint discrimination or intolerance preventing us from creating open perspectives. If we rise above the imprisonment of fixed ideas, we make an essential step toward personal growth and self-esteem
Erik Pevernagie



How many times have we heard of people facing discrimination? How many times have you faced discrimination? 

Unfortunately, most of us have faced discrimination at some point in our lives.

What is discrimination?

Discrimination is the biassed, unjust, or prejudiced treatment of an individual, or groups of people, based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, class, gender, age, sexual orientation, skin colour, health status, occupation, income, religion and various other aspects that directly or indirectly create segregation among people.

Unfortunately, even in this advanced age, it exists like a time bomb in social situations, workplaces, healthcare facilities and at home all around the globe. 

Discrimination in any form can seriously harm people‚Äôs health and well-being. When it happens people experience fear, stress, and anxiety; face stigma and social isolation leading to hazardous behaviours, further affecting their overall well-being.

People discriminate when there is a lack of understanding or resist things they don‚Äôt understand; they are insecure about themselves and don‚Äôt know the truth. Pride is another reason that humans discriminate. 

We need to talk about discrimination and create awareness that treating people unfairly is a violation of human rights.

The war against discrimination has been going on for a long time. Inspiring personalities like Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, Desmond Tutu, Alice Paul, Susan B. Anthony, George Orwell, Helen Keller, and Nelson Mandela all stood up against discrimination. 

Some of the bestselling books like The Viral Underclass (Steven W. Thrasher), Caste (Isabel Wilkerson), Evicted (Matthew Desmond), and Invisible Women (Caroline Criado Perez) deal with Discrimination in its many forms and voice their thoughts against it through their protagonists.

States have a moral, as well as legal obligation to eradicate discriminatory laws and enact some laws and policies to protect people from the curse of discrimination.

Many countries have laws against discrimination but it's still a problem in different layers of society in those countries.

Regrettably, many countries have and still use discrimination as a way to govern.

Sadly, some reports show that inequality is continuously growing for more than 70 percent of the global population, slowing down economic and social development.

Imagine a world free from discrimination: a diverse, equitable and inclusive world where each human being is treated equally!





Zero Discrimination Day is celebrated globally on  Mar 1, every year. It‚Äôs an annual celebration by the United Nations and other international organisations to acknowledge that each individual matters before the law and in practice. The day creates momentum for the global movement of solidarity to end all forms of discrimination towards any individual; creates awareness for the right of everyone to live a full and productive life with dignity; promotes equality and inclusion of diversity; peace and compassion. 

Michel Sidib√©, who was the UNAIDS Director in 2013, came up with the idea from World AIDS Day, a day that fights against maltreatment of those affected with HIV/AIDS and launched the Zero Discrimination Campaign in December 2013. The day was first celebrated by the UN on Mar 1, 2014.

The symbol for Zero Discrimination Day is the butterfly for transformation- a positive transformation of the mindsets of people to accept inclusiveness in diversity. People share their stories and photos with this symbol as a means to end discrimination. 

This year, 2024, marks the tenth anniversary of Zero Discrimination Day. The theme of 2024 is 'to protect everyone's health, protect everyone's rights,' emphasising the importance and need to protect people's health, and rights, and to put an end to AIDS. The whole month of March will be dedicated to this purpose through events, activities and messages to remind the world of this vital lesson and a call to action.

Schools, universities, businesses, and other organisations of many countries take part in the day and host events to highlight the need for improved discrimination laws. 

Discrimination is still a big problem today. To make real progress, we need to end discrimination at the basic level in our communities. It‚Äôs essentially a human rights violation and needs to be challenged and dealt with seriously. 

Every one of us can do something to make a difference. Even small actions can cause a ripple effect and make societies more equal and fair.

Let‚Äôs all wage a war against the discrimination faced by women and girls in all their diversity raise awareness and mobilise actions to promote equality and empowerment for women and girls. The International Women‚Äôs Day campaign theme this year, on Mar 1, is 'Inspire Inclusion'. It's crucial to empower women and promote their inclusion in all spheres of life to accelerate sustainable development. To acquire this, ending all forms of discrimination towards women and providing equal access to education and opportunities for employment is a must. It will eventually help them to be equal players in decision-making ‚Äì be it climate change or other issues and have a chain reaction in all other development areas. 

Facing discrimination at work can be detrimental to the mental health and well-being of the workforce. Organisations need to support and deal with it strongly.

Discrimination against race and ethnicity is a grave issue in the workplace. As many as 70 percent of people admit that they face discrimination at the workplace. Inclusion promotes creativity and generates fresh perspectives and ideas, enhancing people‚Äôs experience and thereby boosting productivity.

Perhaps, the first step to promote a zero-discrimination culture in the workplace is to implement an effective bias-free recruitment process.

Regular awareness training on diversity and anti-discrimination are great ways to maintain a zero-discrimination culture. These help employees become more aware of unconscious biases; motivate positive behaviours; and create a culture of respect, diversity and inclusivity leading to a healthy environment.

Guaranteeing proper anti-discrimination policies and implementation ensures a comfortable, inclusive workplace for all.

We can also participate by sharing the day on social media; joining campaigns; celebrating everyone‚Äôs differences; appreciating how different and unique each person is; helping others to be free from bias; helping friends if they have experienced any discrimination; making them aware of its effects on their health and well-being; help them to avail services for the just cause. Implementation of actions at home for a discrimination-free environment is also important.

We still have a long way to go. Knowing about discrimination is crucial, especially for those who experience it. But knowing that discrimination exists isn't enough. A collective effort by all to take action is needed to remove discrimination to create a more inclusive world.  

We, as individuals, are responsible for our thoughts and actions. Let's celebrate humanity in all its differences to work together to create a world free of prejudice and discrimination. 

It starts from our households first, then the society, educational institutions, our workplaces and the world around us.

We need to put a stop to this. Say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô to discrimination.




We may belong to different races and have different colours. We may speak different languages and follow different religions. We may have different perceptions and live in different realities. But we all live in one world and belong to a single humanity.
Mouloud Benzadi





Before God, we, humans are all equal. Let‚Äôs try to awaken our inner conscience and stand against a society that discriminates against people.

Will you be a part of the greater good and help make this world a better, beautiful place where all can lead a happy discrimination-free life?

Let's act and make it happen!

 Jointly promote the building of the community with a shared future for mankind by China and Bangladesh ,"
                        
                        
                        On Jan 11, 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on her reelection. On the same day, Chinese Premier of State Council Li Qiang sent a congratulatory message to Sheikh Hasina on her reelection. China expected that our two countries would make joint efforts to further implement the important consensus President Xi Jinping reached with the Honourable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Johannesburg, South Africa, last August, enhance political mutual trust, promote traditional friendship, further synergise development strategies, and promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, so as to uplift the China-Bangladesh Strategic Partnership of Cooperation to a new height.China and Bangladesh are both developing countries and populous countries, and both are at a critical stage of their respective development and revitalisation. Since the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, especially after the reform and opening-up, we have completed the industrialisation process that took Western developed countries hundreds of years, and China created the ‚Äútwo miracles‚Äù rarely seen elsewhere in the world, namely rapid economic development and long-term social stability, opening up a broad prospect for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The practice has proved that Chinese Modernisation is the only correct way to construct and rejuvenate a strong nation. Chinese Modernisation breaks the myth of ‚ÄúModernisation = Westernisation‚Äù, shows another picture of modernisation, expands the choices of paths for developing countries towards modernisation, and provides a Chinese solution for mankind‚Äôs search for a better social system.Great transformation is accelerating across the world. Changes of the world, of our times, and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. In the face of global risks and challenges, it is hardly possible for any country to stand alone. Only through solidarity and cooperation can we overcome the difficulties of the times. At the recent Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave further Chinese proposals to solve the questions of what kind of world to build and how to build it. I would like to share them with friends from all walks of life in Bangladesh.On Mar 23, 2013, at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, Chinese President Xi Jinping creatively put forward the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind with a profound grasp of the trend of the times, a broad strategic vision, outstanding political wisdom and a strong sense of responsibility.In summary, in building a community with a shared future for mankind, the goal is to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity, the pathway is promoting global governance that features extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, the guiding principle is to apply the common values of humanity, the basic underpinning lies in building a new type of international relations, the strategic guidance comes from the implementation of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and the platform for action is high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. On this basis, we seek to bring countries together to meet challenges and achieve prosperity for all, and usher in a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress for our world.Building a community with a shared future for mankind is the core tenet of Xi Jinping‚Äôs Thought on Diplomacy. It is based on our deepening understanding of the laws governing the development of human society, reflects the Chinese Communists‚Äô worldview, perception of order, and values, accords with the common aspiration of people in all countries, and points the direction for the progress of world civilisations. It is also the noble goal pursued by China in conducting major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for the new era.Over the past 10 years, the building of a community with a shared future for mankind has expanded from a Chinese initiative to an international consensus, from a beautiful vision to a rich practice, from a conceptual proposition to a scientific system, and has become a glorious banner that leads the way forward in the times. From the bilateral to the multilateral, from the regional to the global level, China has built various forms of communities with a shared future with dozens of countries and regions, and has promoted the building of a community with a shared future in the areas of health, human beings and nature, the Internet and the oceans and seas, achieving fruitful results.China calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world, forging a broader international consensus, proposing more effective solutions and enhancing the practicality and guidance for building a community with a shared future for humankind. We advocate that the multipolar world should be equal, that is, to insist on the equality of all countries, oppose hegemony and power politics, oppose the monopoly of a few countries in international affairs, and effectively promote the democratisation of international relations. International issues should be resolved through consultation among all countries, and the future and destiny of the world should be in the hands of all countries. We advocate that the multipolarity world should be orderly, that is, to ensure that the process of multipolarity is generally stable and constructive and that all countries, regardless of their size, can play their due and constructive role in it. All countries should jointly abide by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, adhere to the universally accepted basic norms of international relations and practise genuine multilateralism.China calls for universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation, maintaining the vitality and momentum of global economic growth, leading economic globalisation in the right direction, and providing a solid foundation for building a community with a shared future for mankind. We advocate that economic globalisation should be inclusive, that is, to respond to the universal aspirations of all countries in the world, especially the developing countries, to address the imbalance in development among and within countries resulting from the global allocation of resources, to achieve both complete and balanced development, and to promote globalisation that is conducive to the accelerated development of all countries in the world, especially the developing countries. We advocate that economic globalisation should be inclusive, that is, to oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, to resist discriminatory and exclusionary standards and rules, and to support countries in taking a path of development that is in line with their own national conditions, while at the same time joining hands to create common development for all humankind.Building a community with a shared future for humankind underscores the general trend of history and the direction of the people‚Äôs hearts. More and more countries have come to realise that the future of the world should be jointly controlled by all countries and created by all of us hand in hand. We must hold high the banner of building a community with a shared future for humankind, forge a broader international consensus on a series of major issues facing today, propose more effective solutions, bring countries together to meet challenges and achieve prosperity for all, and usher in a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress for our world.Over the 52 years since its independence, Bangladesh has always been committed to exploring the path of modernisation in line with its own national conditions and has made commendable achievements. We hope that under the leadership of Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the new Bangladeshi Government will lead the Bangladeshi people to walk faster and steadier on the path of national prosperity and rejuvenation. Our two nations are set to embrace a historic opportunity to further elevate bilateral relations and friendly cooperation in various fields next year, which marks the 50th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties. China is willing to work with Bangladesh to enhance political mutual trust, promote traditional friendship, further synergise development strategies, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and expand new cooperation in a wider range of areas, including higher levels of connectivity, renewable energy, the Blue Economy, financial stability, digital empowerment, scientific and technological innovation, agriculture and food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development, and so on. We will work together to achieve common development and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

The practice has proved that Chinese Modernisation is the only correct way to construct and rejuvenate a strong nation. Chinese Modernisation breaks the myth of ‚ÄúModernisation = Westernisation‚Äù, shows another picture of modernisation, expands the choices of paths for developing countries towards modernisation, and provides a Chinese solution for mankind‚Äôs search for a better social system.Great transformation is accelerating across the world. Changes of the world, of our times, and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. In the face of global risks and challenges, it is hardly possible for any country to stand alone. Only through solidarity and cooperation can we overcome the difficulties of the times. At the recent Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave further Chinese proposals to solve the questions of what kind of world to build and how to build it. I would like to share them with friends from all walks of life in Bangladesh.On Mar 23, 2013, at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, Chinese President Xi Jinping creatively put forward the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind with a profound grasp of the trend of the times, a broad strategic vision, outstanding political wisdom and a strong sense of responsibility.In summary, in building a community with a shared future for mankind, the goal is to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and shared prosperity, the pathway is promoting global governance that features extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, the guiding principle is to apply the common values of humanity, the basic underpinning lies in building a new type of international relations, the strategic guidance comes from the implementation of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, and the platform for action is high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. On this basis, we seek to bring countries together to meet challenges and achieve prosperity for all, and usher in a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress for our world.Building a community with a shared future for mankind is the core tenet of Xi Jinping‚Äôs Thought on Diplomacy. It is based on our deepening understanding of the laws governing the development of human society, reflects the Chinese Communists‚Äô worldview, perception of order, and values, accords with the common aspiration of people in all countries, and points the direction for the progress of world civilisations. It is also the noble goal pursued by China in conducting major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for the new era.Over the past 10 years, the building of a community with a shared future for mankind has expanded from a Chinese initiative to an international consensus, from a beautiful vision to a rich practice, from a conceptual proposition to a scientific system, and has become a glorious banner that leads the way forward in the times. From the bilateral to the multilateral, from the regional to the global level, China has built various forms of communities with a shared future with dozens of countries and regions, and has promoted the building of a community with a shared future in the areas of health, human beings and nature, the Internet and the oceans and seas, achieving fruitful results.China calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world, forging a broader international consensus, proposing more effective solutions and enhancing the practicality and guidance for building a community with a shared future for humankind. We advocate that the multipolar world should be equal, that is, to insist on the equality of all countries, oppose hegemony and power politics, oppose the monopoly of a few countries in international affairs, and effectively promote the democratisation of international relations. International issues should be resolved through consultation among all countries, and the future and destiny of the world should be in the hands of all countries. We advocate that the multipolarity world should be orderly, that is, to ensure that the process of multipolarity is generally stable and constructive and that all countries, regardless of their size, can play their due and constructive role in it. All countries should jointly abide by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, adhere to the universally accepted basic norms of international relations and practise genuine multilateralism.China calls for universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation, maintaining the vitality and momentum of global economic growth, leading economic globalisation in the right direction, and providing a solid foundation for building a community with a shared future for mankind. We advocate that economic globalisation should be inclusive, that is, to respond to the universal aspirations of all countries in the world, especially the developing countries, to address the imbalance in development among and within countries resulting from the global allocation of resources, to achieve both complete and balanced development, and to promote globalisation that is conducive to the accelerated development of all countries in the world, especially the developing countries. We advocate that economic globalisation should be inclusive, that is, to oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, to resist discriminatory and exclusionary standards and rules, and to support countries in taking a path of development that is in line with their own national conditions, while at the same time joining hands to create common development for all humankind.Building a community with a shared future for humankind underscores the general trend of history and the direction of the people‚Äôs hearts. More and more countries have come to realise that the future of the world should be jointly controlled by all countries and created by all of us hand in hand. We must hold high the banner of building a community with a shared future for humankind, forge a broader international consensus on a series of major issues facing today, propose more effective solutions, bring countries together to meet challenges and achieve prosperity for all, and usher in a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress for our world.Over the 52 years since its independence, Bangladesh has always been committed to exploring the path of modernisation in line with its own national conditions and has made commendable achievements. We hope that under the leadership of Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the new Bangladeshi Government will lead the Bangladeshi people to walk faster and steadier on the path of national prosperity and rejuvenation. Our two nations are set to embrace a historic opportunity to further elevate bilateral relations and friendly cooperation in various fields next year, which marks the 50th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic ties. China is willing to work with Bangladesh to enhance political mutual trust, promote traditional friendship, further synergise development strategies, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and expand new cooperation in a wider range of areas, including higher levels of connectivity, renewable energy, the Blue Economy, financial stability, digital empowerment, scientific and technological innovation, agriculture and food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable development, and so on. We will work together to achieve common development and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

 Increasing urban vegetation can improve air quality ,"
                        
                        
                        Air pollution is a considerable environmental hazard in urban and sub-urban areas that affects human health mainly through the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, leading to increased hospitalisations and deaths worldwide. Exposure to high levels of air pollution can cause a variety of adverse health outcomes and increase the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease, and lung cancer. Air pollution has caused 22‚Äì53 percent of global deaths from cardiovascular-related diseases and lung cancer.Figure shows the cycle of airborne PM. A: airborne PM is comprised of dust from ground activities, biomass from ground-level combustion, and the emissions originated from underground fossil-fuel; B: Urban vegetation as well as urban buildings intercept and retain the airborne PM; C: PM captured by plants as well as building surfaces resuspended by winds, or washed off by rainfall; D, PM back to the ground and deposited into the soil.CAUSES OF AIR POLLUTIONIn urban areas, air pollution is mainly caused by road traffic emissions, construction, rapid urbanisation, industrialisation, and open burning. Air pollution is characterised by particulate matter (PM) and various toxic gases, including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and ozone. Particulate matter is of greater concern due to its serious negative effects on human health than those of other air pollutants. PM consists of several solid or liquid particles that suspend in the atmosphere. The most health-harmful pollutants‚Äîclosely associated with excessive premature mortality‚Äîare fine PM2.5 particles that penetrate deep into lung passageways. Due to rapid development in urban and sub-urban areas, PM is being continuously released into the urban atmosphere, and there are, in fact, little or no measures to control air pollution.AIR POLLUTION IN MAJOR CITIES IN BANGLADESH AND HUMAN HEALTH In Bangladesh, industrialisation and urbanisation focusing on rapid economic growth have resulted in massive environmental costs, which have aggravated the outlook for sustainable economic development. Bangladesh is the world‚Äôs most polluted country, where the annual average particulate pollution (PM2.5) level exceeds both the World Health Organisation guideline of 5 ¬µg/m¬≥ and the country‚Äôs own national standard of 15 ¬µg/m¬≥. Even in the least polluted district of Sylhet, particulate pollution is 9.7 times the WHO PM2.5 guideline and 3.2 times the national standard. Dhaka, Chattogram, Narayanganj, and Khulna are the major cities in Bangladesh that have the highest PM concentrations among some cities in the world. The main sources of fine PM (PM2.5) and coarse PM (PM10) are brick kilns, motor vehicles, construction activities, and road transport. Air pollution is one of the most important risk factors for mortality (123,000 deaths in 2017) in Bangladesh, of which more than 47,000 deaths have been attributed to exposure to outdoor PM2.5. Particulate pollution is the second-greatest threat to human health in Bangladesh (closely following cardiovascular diseases), taking 6.8 years off the life of the average Bangladeshi.AIR POLLUTANTS REMOVED BY VEGETATIONResearch found that urban trees and vegetation have the capacity to reduce atmospheric PM concentration by depositing on leaves, while the physical properties of the tree cover and planting pattern in urban areas may improve the microclimate of cities. Urban vegetation can reduce 40 percent of NO2 and 60 percent of PM concentrations in street canyons. Research in Australia reported that trees were found to remove a higher amount of air pollutants compared to the green wall and green roofs in city areas, and areas with less greenspace coverage were found to have higher concentrations of PM than the areas with high greenspace coverage, even taking vehicular traffic into account. Deposition of PM on leaves depends on quantity and sources, tree leaf morphology, leaf orientation, weather conditions, and wind speed. In the winter season, when rainfall is limited, the concentration of PM is usually high. The surface and shape of the leaves also affect the PM deposition on them. Oblong and ovate-shaped leaves, which are widest in the middle, accumulated the highest amount of PM. On the other hand, obovate-shaped leaves, which are the slenderest below the middle, accumulated the least amount of PM. Our research in Chattogram City found that the hairy, rough-surfaced leaves of Psidium guajava (guava) and Tectona grandis (segun) deposit a higher amount of PM because they can intercept more PM than leaves with a smooth surface. We also documented that roadside had lower relative greenspace but the highest concentration of atmospheric PM, which was up to 56% higher than that of residential, park, and commercial areas where relative greenspaces were higher. Our results show that tree species such as Psidium guajava (guava), Artocarpus heterophyllus (kanthal), Swietenia mahagoni (mahagoni), Tectona grandis (segun), and Mangifera indica (aam) deposit a higher amount of PM on leaves, and PM deposition was higher at lower tree heights.WAYS FORWARD ‚ÄãRapid urbanisation, particularly in developing countries, coupled with infrastructure development and industrialization has had a serious impact on urban air quality, and ambient air quality has been causing many life-threatening diseases. Therefore, it is essential and sensible to find out economically and ecologically feasible and effective ways that can remove atmospheric PM and protect humans from exposure to polluted air. Research has shown that urban trees can remove PM through deposition on leaves. The concentration and deposition of PM on leaves depend on leaf surface, shape, and tree height. Therefore, for better removal of PM, planting trees with oblong, ovate-shaped, and rough-surfaced leaves that are lower in height is recommended because these attributes of trees have a higher potential for deposition of PM. The expansion of urban greenspaces would be a low-cost solution to reduce PM pollution, and these urban greenspaces have many other health and ecosystem services for sustainable cities.

 Did Winston & Strawn cross an ethics line in a copycat court filing? ,"
                        
                        
                        Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but that‚Äôs not how attorneys at a small intellectual property firm saw it when a team from 850-lawyer Winston & Strawn allegedly copied one of their court filings ‚Äúnearly verbatim.‚Äù Boston-based, six-lawyer Hsuanyeh Law Group last month sued Winston, and four of its lawyers for copyright infringement ‚Äî though making the claim stick could be a challenge based on factors that include what constitutes publication of a legal motion. Technical copyright issues aside, the suit in my mind raises a broader question: Is it ethically permissible for lawyers to copy each other‚Äôs work? Not just a phrase or sentence, but cutting and pasting entire pages of text without attribution? Such plagiarism would be career-ending in academia or journalism. But in the legal profession, it falls into a gray area.‚ÄúPlagiarism‚Äîwhat Judge Richard Posner defined as ‚Äòunacknowledged copying‚Äô‚Äîis strictly forbidden in many fields,‚Äù Stanford Law professor Nora Freeman Engstrom, an expert in legal ethics, told me. ‚ÄúBut in law, copying is complicated.‚Äù That‚Äôs because penning a legal brief isn‚Äôt like other writing, where original thinking and artful prose are prized. As Engstrom noted, ‚ÄúIn litigation, efficiency and judicial economy are of greater importance,‚Äù she said via email, adding that it would be ""wasteful"" to write every court document from scratch. Still, the fight between Winston, which declined to comment, and Hsuanyeh, which did not respond to requests for comment, makes me wonder how far copying can go before it crosses a line ‚Äî assuming a line even exists. The case started out ordinarily enough. According to court papers, two Taiwan-based companies ‚Äî Phison Electronics, represented by Hsuanyeh, and Silicon Motion, represented by Winston ‚Äî were both hit with patent infringement lawsuits on June 2, 2023, by Unification Technologies, or UTL in the Eastern District of Texas. The cases were consolidated (and have since settled), but the two companies did not enter into a joint defense agreement.Phison declined comment, as did lawyers for UTL. Silicon Motion, or SMI, did not respond to a request for comment. The Phison team from Hsuanyeh was first out of the gate to file a motion to dismiss UTL's claim of willful infringement on Aug 23. ‚ÄúThough UTL‚Äôs accusation is redundant and immaterial, it does impugn Phison‚Äôs business reputation, and is therefore scandalous,‚Äù Hsuanyeh wrote in the 10-page filing. The next day, Winston lawyers submitted their own 10-page motion. ‚ÄúThough UTL‚Äôs accusation is redundant and immaterial, it does impugn SMI‚Äôs business reputation, and is therefore scandalous,‚Äù they wrote. Hsuanyeh in its filing continued, ‚ÄúRather than even suggesting questionable behavior, these descriptions are a nod to Phison‚Äôs dedication over the last twenty-plus years to providing valuable and reliable products and services to its customers.‚ÄùLikewise, Winston wrote, ‚ÄúRather than even suggesting questionable behavior, these descriptions are a nod to SMI‚Äôs dedication over the last twenty-plus years to providing valuable and reliable products and services to its customers.‚Äù You get the idea. To be sure, the entire motion is not word-for-word identical. But it‚Äôs pretty darn similar. Hsuanyeh promptly copyrighted its motion. In an email to Winston (included as an exhibit in the copyright lawsuit) Hsuanyeh wrote that it never gave Winston permission to copy the brief, and that replicating it ""does not constitute fair use.‚Äù Winston responded with a sorry-not-sorry letter, writing that ‚Äúno case has ever held that a law firm's copying of a co-defendant's motion constitutes infringement.‚Äù I‚Äôll wait for the court ‚Äì the case is pending before US District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan ‚Äì to sort out the IP issues, including whether filing a motion counts as publication in determining copyright damages. My question for legal ethics experts, though, is whether Winston‚Äôs conduct might also violate any ethical norms.The journalist in me screams ‚ÄúHeck yeah.‚Äù But legal writing isn‚Äôt journalism. In law, it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery common for lawyers to use work written by others and pretend that it's their own,‚Äù Lisa Lerman, professor of law emerita at The Catholic University of America and co-author of the textbook ‚ÄúEthical Problems in the Practice of Law,‚Äù told me. If it saves the client money, that‚Äôs not necessarily bad. The danger is that wholesale copying can ‚Äúmislead courts, clients, and other readers,‚Äù she said, potentially violating the American Bar Association‚Äôs Model Rule 8.4(a) prohibiting dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. Indeed, there are a handful of instances where courts have disciplined lawyers for copying other lawyers‚Äô briefs, although there were often other factors in play. For example, a lawyer in Washington, DC, was disbarred in 2003, for misdeeds that included filing a brief that was ‚Äúvirtually identical‚Äù to one filed by his client's co-defendant and overbilling for the work ‚Äì a clear no-no.A few bar associations, however, have clarified that using another lawyer‚Äôs work without attribution is not automatically deceitful. ‚ÄúThe purpose of a litigation filing is to persuade the court, not to convey an original idea,‚Äù the New York City Bar held in a 2018 opinion. If one lawyer cribs from another, the opinion reasons, it doesn‚Äôt harm the original author, who wrote the brief to serve the lawyer‚Äôs own client and was entitled to be compensated for the work. That compensation, the bar held, ‚Äúis not diminished if some other lawyer later copies from the brief.‚Äù Maybe. But if I was Phison and had paid full price to Hsuanyeh for the motion to dismiss, I‚Äôd be peeved to see that SMI got it one day later from Winston for (presumably) far fewer billable hours.Fordham School of Law ethics professor Bruce Green said that even if Hsuanyeh doesn‚Äôt prevail in its copyright claim, there could be a silver lining. ‚ÄúIf you were a new client deciding which firm to hire, which one would you choose?‚Äù he said. After all, Hsuanyeh can now boast that ‚Äúthe proof in the quality of our work is ‚ÄòWe were cribbed.‚Äú

 Did the US just get lured into war with the Houthis? ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Joe Biden's blistering strikes on Yemen followed weeks of warnings to the Houthis to stop attacking Red Sea shipping - or else. Yet the Houthis continued firing drones and missiles, seemingly goading the United States to follow through on its threats. That has raised a question for some experts: Did the Houthis want a war with America? And if so, why? Gerald Feierstein, a former US ambassador to Yemen, is among those who think the United States has given the Houthis exactly what they wanted: a fight.""Absolutely they have been trying to provoke US retaliation,"" Feierstein told Reuters. ""They've been confident that they could withstand whatever we were going to do. They have seen they win popular support."" The Houthis, who have controlled most of Yemen for nearly a decade, said five fighters had been killed in a total of 73 air strikes. They vowed to retaliate and continue their attacks on shipping, which they say are intended to support Palestinians against Israel, a popular cause in Yemen.The US military said late on Friday it had launched another strike targeting a radar site. After the initial US and British strikes, drone footage on the Houthis' al-Masirah TV showed hundreds of thousands of people in Sanaa chanting slogans denouncing Israel and the United States. Crowds gathered in other Yemeni cities as well. Experts say much of the Houthi confidence comes from having resisted years of attacks from Saudi Arabia. But a US-led campaign against the group could be very different. US Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, told reporters on Thursday that the strikes hit 28 locations with more than 150 munitions. Reviewing the damage, he said he hoped the Houthis would not invite that kind of destruction. ""My guess is if you were operating a ballistic missile launcher last night, you certainly didn't want the strike. But, no, I would hope they didn't want us to strike,"" Sims said.MOUNTAIN FIGHTERS Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the enigmatic leader of Yemen's Houthi fighters, traces his lineage to the Prophet Mohammad. In pre-recorded speeches and sermons, he asserts that his movement is under siege because of its religion. Al-Houthi established a reputation as a fierce battlefield commander before emerging as head of the Houthi movement, mountain fighters who have been battling a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015 in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands, devastated Yemen's economy and left millions hungry. Under the direction of al-Houthi, who is in his 40s, the group has acquired tens of thousands of fighters and a huge arsenal of armed drones and ballistic missiles, largely supplied by Iran. Following the strikes, Sims and other US officials acknowledged that the Houthis would probably make good on their threats to retaliate. On Friday, the Houthis fired an anti-ship ballistic missile into the Red Sea, the Pentagon said. A US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said far from being deterred, the Houthis might see the likely low death toll among their fighters in the strikes as a success for the group, even if their capabilities have been degraded. ""Someone's definition of success really depends on their perspective,"" the official said. With tensions soaring, the price of Brent crude oil rose 1 percent on Friday on concern that supplies could be disrupted. Commercial ship tracking data showed at least nine oil tankers stopping or diverting from the Red Sea.MORE STRIKES? Michael Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East under the Trump administration, said the Pentagon should prepare for additional military action. ""The US should start planning to increase our response to further attacks in the Red Sea or Syria and Iraq,"" he said. ""And Iran's IRGC should be included in those targets,"" he added, using an acronym for Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran champions the Houthis as part of its regional ""axis of resistance"" - a collection of Iran-backed groups that includes Palestinian militant group Hamas and militia in Iraq and Syria. The United States accuses Iran of enabling the Houthi Red Sea attacks, providing the military capabilities and intelligence to carry them out. The Houthis deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system and regional aggression. Still, Feierstein cautions that the Houthi defiance of the United States and its allies helps burnish their brand in the Middle East, a concern shared by some current US officials. ""Regionally, it raises the Houthi profile. It puts them in the first rank of Iranian affiliates in the 'Axis of Resistance,'"" Feierstein said. ""We shouldn't give the Houthis what they want, which is exactly what we did.""

" Year of elections, especially in US, to shape Ukraine, Gaza and wider conflicts ","
                        
                        
                        As 2023 draws to a close, both sides in the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts signalled they expect continued fighting through much of the new year when dozens of countries, including the United States, go to the polls.About two billion people in at least 50 countries will hold elections in 2024, including in India, Russia, Britain, the European Union and across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas.Some are more unpredictable than others ‚Äì few expect Vladimir Putin not to win another six years in office in Russia‚Äôs presidential vote in March. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fate is seen as tied to the war in Gaza. Many expect him to be ousted as soon as it ends.It remains unclear whether Ukraine will hold its own presidential vote in March. But the election that matters most for the world at large is November‚Äôs US presidential vote, and whether or not Donald Trump returns to office.The difficulties of predicting who will win, as well as what a more unrestrained, anti-establishment Trump might do in power, in part help explain the dynamics in multiple conflicts across the world. Put simply, all sides want to be positioned as best they can before the November vote and possible changes in US foreign policy.It is a dynamic that says much about the state of international power, with increasingly assertive rivals to a perceived declining but still powerful United States, whose own internal politics look more and more unbridgeable.Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, China's leaning on self-ruled Taiwan and military pressure against the Philippines see Moscow and Beijing willing to use methods that until recently would have felt almost unthinkable against Washington‚Äôs allies.The Biden administration has interpreted those as deliberate tests of US power, arguing that the United States needs to stand behind its allies while avoiding unnecessary escalation.That is already proving a challenging path. Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza has shown that US influence can be limited. The Netanyahu government arguably believes it can act as it can in Gaza without losing the broad support of the United States, despite increasingly public US calls for moderation.For Washington, the rising attacks on Red Sea shipping are just one sign of the regional spillover of that war. This week saw the United States attack Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq, following what US officials say have been more than 100 attacks against US forces there and in Syria since the middle of October.Largely outside the headlines, experts warn that ongoing civil conflict in Sudan and Myanmar could also escalate in 2024, with the Kremlin and to a lesser extent Beijing backing ruling forces attempting to cling to power as several million people face hunger and displacement.PRE-ELECTION POSITIONINGEvents in the Middle East raise the proposition that the early months of 2024 could see further escalation there, deepening US overstretch in the run-up to a perhaps chaotic November presidential vote.At worst, these multiple crises may essentially fuel each other, just as the Ukraine conflict has forced up global food prices and deepened already serious humanitarian situations in poorer countries and conflict zones around the world.Within Ukraine and Eastern Europe, there is no shortage of complaints that the United States and its European allies could have done more to arm the Kyiv government in 2023, and that it may now be too late to achieve breakthroughs in 2024.They are likely to intensify given Republican congressional opposition to further US support and the very real prospect that a Trump administration might cut off Kyiv entirely and force it to sue for peace.In other areas, however, the actions of a Trump administration are much harder to predict. In his first term, Trump was outspoken in criticising China, flirting with more open support for Taiwan that has been continued by the Biden administration.The Republican front-runner is sufficiently unpredictable, however ‚Äì as is his choice of senior officials ‚Äì that it is impossible to guarantee what path he might take on relations with Beijing, including how hawkish a Trump-run administration might prove.Who runs the government in Taiwan, which China claims as its own, will be determined in a Jan. 13 presidential vote. Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Lai Ching-te looks likely to beat the opposition Kuomintang that favours much friendlier relations with Beijing.A DPP victory would combine with ongoing Chinese pressure on the Philippines over its military presence on disputed islands in the South China Sea. As with the current face-off with the Iran-backed Houthis in the Red Sea, these are confrontations on which the Biden administration would like to limit divisive headlines and escalation in the run-up to November.OTHER POWER DYNAMICSOther elections will also drive battlefield dynamics and other less-lethal confrontations. Putin‚Äôs reaction, some suspect, to a Trump win could prompt him to further militarise the Russian economy and push for full mobilisation to attack Ukraine even more mercilessly.European parliamentary elections in June will be closely watched for signs of further rises in support for far right parties, particularly after November‚Äôs election in the Netherlands saw long-running Prime Minister Mark Rutte lose his majority. Some expect him to quit Dutch politics in the coming months, potentially to take over from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at its July summit in Washington.Further far right victories would be seen as positive for Putin, particularly after Slovakia dropped support for Ukraine after nationalist and populist Robert Fico won elections in September.In Britain, where Labour leader Keir Starmer is likely to win elections scheduled for some point next year, a new government may hope to win over nearby allies by following Canada and Germany in committing more forces to Eastern Europe. Overall, however, worries over a potential US pullback are likely to increase the clout and strategic importance of rearming major European governments, particularly those in Warsaw and Berlin.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to win India‚Äôs April-May elections ‚Äì but a reluctance to look weak following a Houthi missile strike on an Indian tanker has helped prompt New Delhi to send warships to the Red Sea, a region in which India has historically attempted to avoid becoming too enmeshed.More broadly, actual or postponed elections in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia are seen potentially as part of a growing trend towards authoritarianism across Asia and the world. Each year of the 2020s has seen a major shock so far ‚Äì 2024 will determine whether that trend continues.* Peter Apps is a Reuters columnist writing on defence and security issues.

 US and allies face tough choices amid growing Red Sea crisis ,"
                        
                        
                        As the Pentagon asked allies to provide warships for an international task force to protect Red Sea commercial shipping from mounting drone attacks from Yemen this week, one of the United States‚Äô closest partners appeared to be holding back.According to widespread media reporting within Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese‚Äôs government remains reluctant to send one of its three guided missile frigates to the Middle East at a time of simultaneously rising offshore confrontation with China in Southeast Asia.It is a sign of growing military overstretch affecting both the United States and many of its allies.Within Washington itself, strategists, officials and analysts are engaged in an increasingly public argument over how the United States should balance its own strategic priorities around the world, particularly supporting Ukraine fight off Russia's invasion at the same time as bolstering the self-ruled island of Taiwan against potential aggression from Beijing.US officials such as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin argue that as the only superpower with truly global reach, the United States retains the ability to ‚Äúwalk and chew gum at the same time‚Äù. Increasingly, however, it appears that Washington will finish 2023 handling three increasingly live regional confrontations in Europe, the Middle East and South China Sea as well as broader worries around Taiwan.Inevitably, the mounting disruption to global trade produced by the Red Sea crisis ‚Äì as well as the need to avoid the Gaza war turning into a much larger conflict ‚Äì is now the immediate US priority. The longer attacks continue in the Red Sea, the greater the pressure on the United States to strike Houthi targets within Yemen.That is something Washington appears desperate to avoid ‚Äì US troops in Iraq and Syria have already seen a significant uptick in attacks against them from Iranian-backed militia since the Gaza war began. Striking Tehran‚Äôs allies in Yemen might well prompt significant escalation on that front, something the Biden administration would rather avoid in an election year.But that may now be becoming unavoidable. As of Tuesday, Houthi militants had attacked at least 12 commercial vessels, with 25 crew members of the Israeli-owned MV Galaxy Leader still being held prisoner. Perhaps even more importantly, however, large numbers of merchant ships are now avoiding the area altogether, prompting the United States to launch its international Operation Prosperity Guardian naval mission.US, French and British warships ‚Äì mainly US destroyers ‚Äì have brought down dozens of attacking drones. That is likely to be an expensive process. The attacking Iran-built drones cost an estimated $2,000 to $20,000 each, but the missiles US and other allied warships are likely using to bring them down may cost in excess of $1-2 million a shot.While the United States has extensive stockpiles, other nations have fewer rockets in their stores. The last two years have seen unprecedented demand for military ordnance, just as multiple nations face budget constraints alongside a lack of personnel, ships and more.Over the last two years, the Ukraine war has largely exhausted Western arsenals of artillery shells and a host of short and long-range weapons, while authorities in both Kyiv and Moscow have struggled to find the troops and firepower to make good on planned offensives. Now, combating a sustained drone offensive from Yemen could ultimately exhaust the vital surface-to-air missiles Western warships rely on to defend themselves.CHALLENGE OF CREDIBILITYThe United States says further military support to the government in Kyiv in 2024 will depend on congressional agreement that appears increasingly challenging. Within Washington itself, a growing number of voices argue that there are limits to what the United States should do in Europe or the Middle East in order to concentrate on what might ultimately be even greater challenges in Asia.Put together, that offers a range of challenges on a scale the United States and its allies might have found unthinkable before the start of the crisis-ridden 2020s.Half-way around the world from the Middle East, the United States is simultaneously attempting to manage a mounting confrontation between China and the Philippines, with Chinese coastguard and naval vessels using what appears to be intensifying force against Filipino efforts to resupply its forces on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal.With the United States pledged by mutual defence treaty to support the Philippines should periodic collisions and use of fire hoses escalate to outright force, that confrontation is being closely watched for its implications across the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, despite what appeared to be a relatively genial US-Chinese November California presidential summit.In the long run, however, Beijing appears determined to unify Taiwan and the mainland at some point, definitely before the centenary of the end of Communist victory in China‚Äôs civil war in 2049. Some anticipate a potential Chinese assault coming much sooner, potentially in the later part of the current decade.In October, shortly before the summit, US officials complained of Chinese aircraft performing what they described as unsafe manoeuvres near US planes. The following month, Australia complained a Chinese warship had lashed an Australian frigate with its powerful active sonar despite a warning Australian divers were in the water, inflicting hearing injuries.The latter incident may help explain Australian reluctance to send further vessels to the Middle East.Up to now, the Biden administration has argued that its support for Ukraine and Israel fits within its broader effort to deter China from attacking Taiwan, showcasing Washington‚Äôs commitment to stand behind all allies. Increasingly, however, that dialogue is changing to examine what tough choices the United States and allies might need to make in the years to come. FEARS OF OVERSTRETCHAustralia is not the only major US ally that looks to be limiting its main contribution to Prosperity Guardian. Canada too looks likely to send a handful of staff officers to the mission's headquarters rather than a warship, a sign the Ottawa government too would rather conserve its naval forces for priorities in the Pacific.Japan and South Korea, regular contributors to previous counter piracy US-led forces in the region, are also notable by their absence from the current mission, despite the disruption to shipping also affecting Asian import-export routes.For now, the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower is reported heading for waters off Yemen and may or may not be planning to strike against the Houthis. That might feel like the standard US response to such a situation, but is now taking place in a much more complex, interconnected world.According to US officials, Chinese warships ostensibly on counter-piracy operations in the region have taken no action to protect nearby attacked merchant ships, even those owned by Hong Kong firms.More broadly, however, analysts monitoring shipping patterns say many Russian, Chinese and vessels flagged to other nations had been continuing to transition Aden largely unaffected, some of them suspected to be part of an off-the-box ‚Äúdark fleet‚Äù shipping Russian oil and gas to Asian nations despite Western sanctions.That poses the most awkward question US and Western officials are avoiding answering ‚Äì whether they believe the Houthi action might be coordinated not just with Iran, but also potentially with Moscow and Beijing. The signs are mixed, however, with some suspected dark fleet vessels now also circling in the Mediterranean and avoiding the Red Sea.Some merchant ships including from major Western shipping firms are turning off their identifying systems to make it harder for attackers to tell the origin of a vessel, suggesting they believe that might give them greater safety.Somehow, the coming weeks will require the world‚Äôs merchant shipping lines and navies to find a way to reopen the Red Sea ideally without a wider conflict.As in Europe, however, where the eventual end of the Ukraine war looks unlikely to stop the wider confrontation between the Kremlin and NATO states, that may simply be the start of a new chapter of widening and worsening international confrontation, continuing to redefine each year what true Western military ‚Äúoverstretch‚Äù might really look like.* Peter Apps is a Reuters columnist writing on defence and security issues.

 Who will compensate for the personal loss and damage caused by climate change? ,"
                        
                        
                        

I met Lipi Begum a few months back at her home in a village in south-western coastal Bangladesh. Her uterus has continuously been displaced from its original place for 13 years. At first, when she started describing her health condition, I wasn‚Äôt able to comprehend what she was saying. But when I realised what she was trying to say, it shook me to my core. Has this really happened in her life? Is this even possible at all?

Gradually, when I started connecting the dots, relating the statistics and evidence with her situation, I realised how common this is among women in coastal Bangladesh. In the case of Lipi, her family spent a considerable amount of their earnings over the past 13 years to treat her and to hold her uterus in the place it should be. Indeed, it is a tough choice for a family with limited income and endless crises. As she had no health insurance, she had to cut all other expenses, including the fundamental needs of her family, like food, clothing, shelter, education, medical care, etc. She can‚Äôt go fishing in the river nearby. So, her family had to depend on her husband‚Äôs sole income. 

Her two babies had died in her womb. Even her life is at risk now, as the doctor warned her she had to remove her uterus through surgery as soon as possible. She is waiting for the family to arrange money for the operation. On the other hand, she wishes to have another child before the final removal of her uterus. But she knows that she has only two options left: either removal of her uterus or a slow and painful journey to death.

I was born on the same coastal line but on the other side of the country. Our people use a proverb: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt rest assured as you are not in your mother‚Äôs womb.‚Äù It means the mother‚Äôs womb is the safest place in the world. Why did Lipi Begum‚Äôs two babies have to die even before being born in their mother‚Äôs womb? Who is responsible for this? 

Lipi knows all of these sufferings are caused only by saltwater invasion. But she doesn‚Äôt know the people behind it.

She is not alone. According to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in 2011, about 20 million people were affected by saltwater, and around half were women. In a recent tour to coastal Bangladesh, our team talked to at least 30 women suffering from a certain level of salinity problem.  





As a radio journalist in 2010, I joined and covered a trial process at a symbolic climate court at Bangabandhu International Conference Center in Dhaka in 2010, where juries held the developed world responsible for climate change. The court ordered compensation from the developed world. The trial was symbolic, and the court didn‚Äôt have the actual jurisdiction to implement its judgement even though the loss and damages, the sufferings and the tears of the people were cruelly substantial. I met one of the female litigants at that trial venue who lost her fisherman-husband in a natural disaster, and the disaster was the impact of climate change. Her husband will never return to take care of the family, earn and feed her and their children. 

But I met Rowshan Akhter, now a retired teacher, who has a fascinating story about going to a real court to hold the culprit responsible for the death of her journalist husband, Mozammel Hossain Montu. This case is considered the first of its kind for many people in the judiciary of Bangladesh to claim compensation for a death in a road transport accident. All three stages of the court of the land, the judge court, the High Court and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, delivered their landmark judgement in favour of her.

Her husband died on Dec 3, 1989. Instead of focusing on sending the driver to jail, she fought for compensation on six heads: loss of potential earnings of her husband, damage caused to the infants for being deprived of father‚Äôs affection, care and nursing; damage caused to the widow for being deprived of husband‚Äôs affection, care and nursing; loss of post-retirement earnings; loss of sons‚Äô ability to use their father‚Äôs goodwill; damage and shock caused to the deceased‚Äôs other family members by the premature death. The High Court and the Appellate Division approved compensation for the first four heads. According to the Appellate Division‚Äôs judgement, total compensation was more than Tk 17 million.





This case opened the opportunity to claim compensation for accidental deaths in Bangladesh. The case of famous Bangladeshi filmmaker Tareque Masud is one of them. A High Court bench ordered three responsible parties to compensate Masud‚Äôs family with Tk 46.17 million in a judgment. In road accident cases, litigants have two options to seek compensation: road transport law for exclusive incidents related to road accidents and tort law for any damage. 

All personal loss and damage must be acknowledged and compensated, whether accidental on the road or climate change-induced incidents. So Lipi or any other climate survivors should have the opportunity to claim compensation from liable parties for their real damage, and this damage money is not a kindness; it‚Äôs a legal obligation.

As the government is responsible for the lives and property of citizens, they must claim compensation from climate abusers. It is mentioned again in the High Court verdict in Rowshan‚Äôs case: ‚ÄúEvery child is born with the expectation of life and with constitutionally guaranteed right to basic requirements for living. Death is inevitable, but premature death in whatever form is not expected and cannot be consoled. Accidental death is also a premature death. The government is answerable to all such premature deaths as it is to protect the citizen and is responsible for the life of a citizen; as such, when any one of whatever class, society, or place meets death by accident, it should be the duty of the government to mitigate the sufferings of the survivors of the family.‚Äù 

The constitution of Bangladesh also guarantees the protection of law to the life, liberty, body, reputation, and property of every citizen and every other person within Bangladesh‚Äôs territory. 

What actions have been taken to protect climate survivors‚Äô lives, bodies and property in these circumstances? Does it take enough action to protect those things?  

From COP28, the loss and damage fund will start its journey. But how will it compensate for the loss and damage of the most marginal people living in the frontline countries like Bangladesh? Will the people and countries pay Lipi Begum as compensation for all the suffering that she is undergoing? Will they pay her at all? If yes, how? Will she get it through a determined process, or will she have to go to regular court to fight for 34 long years like Rowshan to get the damages? Will she survive to see her victory?

Tort law is not a law of Bangladeshi origin. It‚Äôs Roman law, well-known and practised in the Western judiciaries. Lipi‚Äôs compensation could be much higher if she had just been born on England‚Äôs coastline or any other Western country.

 AI defined 2023. Bullets and ballots will shape 2024 ,"
                        
                        
                        

How to sum up the most important news of the year past? The obvious answer in 2023 is to use Artificial Intelligence. In that spirit, I asked OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Bard ‚Äì two of the most popular generative AI tools ‚Äì to do the job for me.

Their responses show AI‚Äôs power, but also the ways it still falls short, in this case both in terms of Reuters editorial standards and when compared to human editors.

ChatGPT told me that ‚ÄúAs an AI, I don't have real-time access to current events or the internet to know the specific events of 2023‚Äù before offering me ‚Äúa hypothetical scenario based on current trends and topics.‚Äù Its rosy scenario included the global community agreeing ‚Äúto a radical and comprehensive set of measures to reduce carbon emissions significantly by 2030‚Äù, scientists successfully wrapping up final phase clinical trials of an unnamed cancer vaccine, and the United Nations brokering a deal to end decades of geopolitical tensions in an unspecified region of the world.

If only.

Bard was more helpful and accurate, offering me a summary of news from the Russia-Ukraine war (though it was slightly unclear on what year the war started), what happened to the global economy, and details of tech developments, including AI and gene editing. It missed the war between Hamas and Israel.

But even if AI cannot yet match a journalist, the technology‚Äôs emergence in 2023 promised (or threatened, depending on your viewpoint) a profound shift in the way humans operate, and boosted the stock prices of companies that embraced that promise. In 2024, expect more progress and more news on regulators scrambling to keep up.

Next year will also be defined by bullets and ballots.

In October, Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 civilians and taking about 240 more captive. The brutal surprise attack ‚Äì the single most deadly day in Israel‚Äôs history ‚Äì triggered a massive retaliatory operation. Israel has pounded Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza for weeks, ordered the movement of more than a million people within the tiny enclave, and killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, more than 14,000 Palestinians, including 5,000 children.

A days-long pause in late November to allow Hamas to return some Israeli hostages and Israel to return some Palestinian prisoners to Gaza, ended and the fighting looks likely to drag into 2024.

The conflict in Ukraine also shows no sign of slowing. Russian and Ukrainian forces continue to fight in Ukraine‚Äôs east and the south, but momentum on both sides has ground to a near halt. The key to any change in the stalemate lies as much in Washington and Brussels ‚Äì and the West‚Äôs appetite for continued help for Ukraine ‚Äì as it does in Moscow and Kyiv.

This was also the year China‚Äôs economic struggles worsened, even as Beijing and Washington attempted to mend relations between their two countries. In 2024, those efforts, and even the likelihood of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, will pivot on what happens in the US presidential elections. A second term for Donald Trump would throw everything up in the air again ‚Äì including the future of US democracy.

The US election will be the single, most defining political event next year, both at home and abroad. But other major stories will emerge from voting booths around the globe.

More than 900 million eligible voters in India will determine the political fate of Prime Minister Narendra Modi next spring. Mexico may cast aside a tradition of machismo and elect Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum as its first female President. And a less competitive race is taking shape in Russia, where Vladimir Putin is seeking another six-year term in office, putting him in the realm of Joseph Stalin‚Äôs lengthy reign over the country.

You will notice our year-end stories look ahead to a range of critical questions for 2024. What‚Äôs next for abortion and reproductive rights in the United States? Is inflation around the world beaten? Will weight loss drugs reverse the obesity epidemic? And can Taylor Swift's power get even bigger?

Like many newsrooms, Reuters is experimenting with how AI can help us package, produce and deliver our journalism. But that journalism will continue to come from our reporters on the ground around the world, covering the news that matters without fear or favour.

 Can technology solve the global climate crisis? ,"
                        
                        
                        

Governments and investors are pouring billions of dollars into emerging technologies to combat global warming in long-shot bets that entrepreneurship can help lead the way to a climate-friendly world.

As officials from nearly 200 countries seek to forge agreements at the UN COP28 climate summit in Dubai this month, they will also be considering deployment of the nascent technologies.

The amount invested worldwide by venture capital and private equity into climate technology startups - in projects ranging from carbon capture and green hydrogen, to food waste reduction and cleaning up heavy industry - totaled $490 billion this year, according to a report by accounting firm PwC.

While that's down 40% from 2022 as economic uncertainty, stubborn inflation and high interest rates bite, it marks a relatively healthy showing given the investments across all business sectors dropped 50% over the same period, PwC said.

Here are some of the investment trends:

CARBON REMOVAL

The world emits around 37 billion metric tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide from fossil fuel and industry each year. One family of technologies, called carbon capture and storage, would tackle that by trapping those emissions before they reach the atmosphere, and storing them underground or using them to make products.

A big question, though, is whether it can work given the costs and the amount of energy required. The International Energy Agency, the West's energy watchdog, said in November that the oil and gas industry is relying excessively on carbon capture, and called the approach an implausible ""illusion"".

Even so, carbon removal is attracting loads of money.

The United States this year, for example, announced it would grant more than $1 billion to two carbon removal projects, in Texas and Louisiana, that would suck more than 2 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year from the sky using a carbon removal technique called direct air capture.





FUSION

Fusion, can generate massive amounts of zero-emissions power by harnessing the energy produced from pushing atoms together, instead of splitting them apart. But the reaction is hard to produce, and harness any energy it generates to the grid.

Investments in fusion slipped this year, part of the broader trend in declining venture investment. International fusion companies raised about $1.4 billion in mostly private money according to the Fusion Industry Association, down from about $2.83 billion in new investment last year.

On the hopeful side for fusion, the number of companies getting investments rose to 43 from 33, spanning a dozen countries, according to the FIA, including the US which has about 25 companies. Other countries pursuing fusion include Australia, China, Germany, Japan, and the UK.

John Kerry, President Joe Biden's climate envoy, is expected to announce at COP28 a global strategy in nuclear fusion.

GREEN HYDROGEN

Hydrogen is a fuel that can be made by electrolyzing water, and which burns clean. If it is produced using renewables like wind or solar power, as opposed to fossil fuel generated power, it is called green hydrogen. If it is produced with nuclear power, its called ""pink"" or ""purple"" hydrogen.

The US is trying to kickstart clean hydrogen, and in October announced $7 billion in grants to seven ""hydrogen hub"" projects across the country. The US Inflation Reduction Act also provides tax credits for hydrogen production.

Governments and companies think green hydrogen could be a way to clean up hard-to-decarbonize industries like steel and cement-making and other industrial manufacturing. But like carbon removal, it is expensive and energy intense, meaning it is unclear if it is doable at scale.

PwC said technologies like green hydrogen and reducing food waste have relatively high emissions reduction potential, but are receiving a small share of start-up investment. In 2023, green hydrogen got 3.9% of global climate-tech venture funding, while food waste got 0.7%, it said.





OTHERS

There are scores of other technologies in development that promise to be game-changers for the climate - if they survive. They include everything from lab-grown meat, to advanced batteries, to insects as a food source.

Among them, lab-grown meat has made some advancements this year. In June, US regulators cleared the first sales of chicken grown from cells in a vat. The meat was served in small portions at high-end restaurants.

The industry says that if it manages to overcome high costs, challenges to scaling up production, and the 'ick-factor', it could revolutionise agriculture and eliminate the considerable emissions related to raising livestock.

ASIA, AFRICA ON THE RISE

Companies in the U.S. still get the most climate tech investment at around 49% of the global total, according to Deloitte, a professional services network.

But other countries have been eating into that share. Funding in China, for example, was 22% from 2020 to 2023, up from 2% in 2010 to 2014, while it has also increased in France, the UK and India and in other countries in Asia and Africa.

David Schatsky, a managing director at Deloitte, said investments in biofuels development has risen in Asia, while electric bike and motorcycle companies are doing well in Africa.

""Entrepreneurship taking hold outside of the developed world has the potential to help attract more capital to these regions if an ecosystem around climate-related technologies can arise,"" Schatsky said.

 Why a murder plot will not turn the US away from India ,"
                        
                        
                        

A brazen murder-for-hire plot against a US citizen, which authorities say was directed by an Indian government official, outwardly seems like a development that could upend the fragile new US-India partnership.

But the countries - each eager for an ally to counterbalance a rising China - appear ready to try to look past the assassination attempt detailed in an US indictment released on Wednesday.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said the unnamed Indian official, whose responsibilities include security and intelligence, and Indian national Nikhil Gupta, 52, plotted this summer to kill a New York City resident who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern India.





They did so - exchanging messages with an undercover DEA agent about the planned assassination - even as President Joe Biden was honouring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with a state visit to the White House on Jun 22.

US officials, after learning about the plot in late July, demanded that India investigate, a senior administration official said. Biden dispatched his CIA chief to New Delhi and raised the issue with Modi during a September summit, outlining ""the potential repercussions for our bilateral relationship were similar threats to persist,"" the official said.

High-level meetings and pledges of closer cooperation have continued, with Biden's secretaries of state and defence visiting Delhi this month. When details of the plot appeared this week the US released a measured statement.

A senior US administration official called the assassination plot a ""serious matter"" and said Washington expects India to stop such activities, even as the Biden administration pursues ""an ambitious agenda to expand our cooperation"" with India.

The US response reflects a desire not to let the issue damage the broader relationship, foreign policy experts said.

""The Biden administration appears to be seeking to compartmentalise this issue from the rest of the strategic relationship,"" said Lisa Curtis, a former senior director for South and Central Asia at the White House's National Security Council.





Biden has made a priority of nurturing ties with India, hoping to counter China‚Äôs ambitions in Asia while drawing India away from Russia as the US seeks to isolate Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

'THEY NEED EACH OTHER'

So far, the New York assassination plot has played out very differently from a similar case in Canada this year.

Canada said in September there were ""credible"" allegations linking Indian agents to the June murder of another Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in a Vancouver suburb.

India angrily rejected Canada‚Äôs claim, sparking a diplomatic row that saw expulsions of diplomats by both sides, and New Delhi threatened to scupper trade talks.

By contrast, India‚Äôs response to the US indictment on Wednesday was conciliatory, saying it was taking the case seriously and investigating.

""India doesn't share a strategic partnership with Canada, which it does with the US"" said Happymon Jacob, an Indian foreign policy expert at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. ""Both the US and India realise that they need each other, perhaps the US a bit more than India.""

The Biden administration's overtures to Modi were already controversial, with some arguing that the Indian leader's Hindu nationalism and authoritarian instincts made him an unreliable partner.

Activists hold Modi responsible for religious riots in his home state of Gujarat in 2002, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died. Modi was denied a US visa in 2005 under a US law that bars entry to foreigners who have committed ""particularly severe violations of religious freedom.""

The June summit was Modi's first state visit to the US, despite taking office in 2014. Sitting alongside Modi in the White House, Biden hailed a relationship ""built on mutual trust, candour, and respect.""

Richard Rossow, an India specialist at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that from the announced timeline of the alleged plot, the Biden Administration would have known about it well ahead of a series of significant high-level engagements.

""So, based on its own merits this issue is not enough to derail ties even if it generated some underlying level of tension,"" he said.

Ashley Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that although the Biden administration ""has bent backwards to avoid a public spat with Delhi,"" the issues of sovereignty involved in an attack on a US citizen inside the United States would be troubling to US officials.

""I think the bilateral relationship will survive this fiasco,"" he said. ""But it will reinforce the qualms of many who believe that the claims about shared values between the US and India are simply mythology.""

 Accelerating change in ensuring sanitation in Bangladesh ,"
                        
                        
                        

For as long as Mayarani remembers living in her village of Tanore Upazila of Rajshahi District, her five-member family always used a pit-latrine made of sack burlap located at the outside of the household. One of the most essential amenities, the toilet, took a good three-minute walk to reach, situated in a nearby rice-field. Accessing this toilet, particularly during night-time, was a very uncomfortable ordeal not only for the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law duo, but also for her 15-year-old granddaughter and seven-year-old grandson.

Unlike the conventional narrative of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law being at loggerheads with each-other, Mayarani, a hard-working Santal woman in her 50s, shares a significantly positive relationship with her daughter-in-law Promila and is incredibly proud of her recent contribution in changing the sanitation situation of their household.

Frustrated by the condition, Promila would often discuss with her husband about building an improved latrine in their premises. But their conversation would typically end abruptly as their meagre income from farming does not leave room for the installation cost.

Amidst this condition, Promila was approached by a BRAC staff at the beginning of this year, who informed her about the opportunity to take out a sanitation loan to build a safely managed latrine. She quickly decided to take out the loan and promptly sold a cow to finance the remaining amount, without any hesitation.

By the middle of this year, Promila‚Äôs initiative allowed her family to own a semi-concrete improved latrine inside their house for the very first-time. Now, going to the toilet is no longer a physically and emotionally draining experience for the women of this family.

This narrative is just one among the myriad stories illustrating the transformation occurring in Bangladesh's sanitation sector, spearheaded by BRAC, the world's largest development organisation. However, there is a pressing need to expedite this transformation happening on the ground to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 6 and hence this year‚Äôs theme of ‚ÄòWorld Toilet Day‚Äô observed on Nov 19 is ‚ÄòAccelerating Change‚Äô.

Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in ensuring access to basic sanitation coverage. Over the last two decades, open defecation has decreased from 34 percent to nearly zero, and possessing a toilet has become a status symbol. Yet, according to JMP estimates for 2020, 75.4 million people in Bangladesh still do not have a decent toilet of their own. Furthermore, climate change impacts such as flood, drought and rising sea levels are projected to further jeopardise the functionality of the existing sanitation systems i.e., toilets, septic tanks.





The government launched a national campaign to do this and BRAC supported the efforts by taking the campaign to the community level, through community mobilisation and forming community-level WASH committees.

However, as the only organisation born and proven in the global south, our approach compels us to take the saying, ‚ÄúIf you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime‚Äù very seriously. So, this was supported by activating market forces - starting rural sanitation centres which sold sanitary construction materials and supporting people to become sanitation entrepreneurs. Rather than simply providing materials, the programme offers loans to individuals from local communities in order for them to establish sanitation enterprises. More than 3,000 sanitation entrepreneurs have been trained in both safe latrine manufacturing procedures and entrepreneurship.The work grew to become the largest WASH programme anywhere managed by an NGO and 39 million people received access to hygienic sanitation in 250 sub-districts of Bangladesh.

As per the United Nations, with just seven years left, the world has to work, on average, five times faster to meet the sanitation target of SDG 6 -- ‚ÄòEnsure access to water and sanitation for all‚Äô-- by 2030 on time. In order to overcome challenges to establish sustainable sanitation systems with limited resources in Bangladesh as well as globally, an accelerated and innovative effort is required more than ever before.

Financing sanitation infrastructure through WASH loans can be an effective way forward for providing affordable sanitation to low-income households while creating a stable source of income. While the importance of public sector investment in large-scale sanitation systems remains critical for achieving SDGs in Bangladesh, availability of WASH loans by organisations such as BRAC will enable thousands of individuals like Promila, who might otherwise be unable to invest a substantial amount upfront, to afford decent and hygienic toilets.

At a time when many are questioning the likelihood of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal for sanitation, BRAC is showcasing that it is possible to not only deliver at scale and with equity, but also to come up with different financing pathways for WASH.

 UK PM Sunak gambles on return of Cameron to win over moderate voters ,"
                        
                        
                        Few expected David Cameron's return to government, but his appointment is one that British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hopes will signal to wavering supporters that the Conservatives are not lurching to the right to win an election expected next year.As well as firing his interior minister, Suella Braverman, after she published an unauthorised article criticising the police's handling of protests, Sunak has used a wider reshuffle to bring back the prime minister who campaigned to remain in the European Union in a referendum on membership he called in 2016.It's a risky strategy - while welcomed by centrist lawmakers, the party's right senses the end of their increased dominance, built during the wars over EU membership, with one fearing the appointment amounted to a ""Brexit surrender"".""He has appointed the man who led the 'remain' campaign and who has got huge problems over his association with Greensill,"" said a Conservative lawmaker on the right of the party, referring to Cameron's lobbying work for a now-collapsed supply chain finance firm.""Is he spoiling for a fight with Conservatives?""The decision to fire Braverman removes from the cabinet one of the most prominent supporters of leaving the EU and means even more of Sunak's top ministers supported remaining in the bloc in 2016. Out of the 29 cabinet roles, at least 16 backed remaining in the EU, compared with 10 who supported leaving.Sunak backed Brexit. Since he became Britain's third prime minister in as many months, Sunak has tried to keep all wings of the party happy - reappointing Braverman, a favourite on the right, to her interior minister role just a week after she was fired in the final days of his predecessor Liz Truss's brief premiership.He has also tried to portray himself as a tough decision-maker and agent of change, ready to take on ""establishment attitudes"" on the environment and crime despite the Conservatives having been in power for more than a decade.Sunak's party still languishes around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party before an election that must happen by January 2025.He has resisted the right's calls to cut taxes before the next election, and his moves could mean Sunak creates a hostile and vocal lobby sitting behind him in parliament.Several of them believe that the party membership, which did not elect Sunak as leader, want what they call traditional Conservative policies and felt Braverman was on-message with her tough approach to tackling illegal immigration and crime. FORWARD, NOT BACK?But centrist lawmakers believe Cameron's appointment is inspired, saying he not only brings a wealth of government experience but is also seen as a moderate, one who can reassure traditional supporters largely in affluent southern England.""It reassures mainstream Tories,"" one Conservative lawmaker said on condition of anonymity. Another pointed out that he won two elections, although in his first victory he depended on the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government.The appointment has done little to unite a party that has taken in-fighting to new levels over the years, particularly since Cameron announced he was holding the EU referendum.Another Conservative lawmaker said the appointment of Cameron was about trying to differentiate Sunak's government from the economic chaos under Truss and the scandal-ridden premiership of her predecessor Boris Johnson.""It is a fascinating and smart move,"" he said. But as he was talking, he asked a former cabinet minister to the right of the party for her thoughts. She replied: ""I thought we were meant to be looking forward, not back.""Some party commentators said it showed Sunak did not believe he could recreate the circumstances in 2019, when Johnson persuaded many voters in traditional Labour-supporting regions in northern and central England to vote Conservative for the first time.In any election the Conservatives will take on not only Labour, but also the centrist Liberal Democrats in southern England, where some lawmakers are fearful the Conservatives were once again being seen as ""the nasty party"".""In many ways, David Cameron's modern conservatism is the very reason I'm here in parliament today,"" wrote Dehenna Davison, a former minister in the housing department who previously announced she was stepping down at the next election.With few Conservatives believing they can win the next election, others might follow her in preparing for a new job.The reshuffle also prompted a number of junior ministers to resign their posts in departments including health, transport and education. Ministers who lose their parliamentary seats at an election face restrictions on what jobs they can immediately take. Those without ministerial positions do not.Keiran Pedley, Ipsos Director of Politics, said it was a ""fair critique"" that Sunak's strategy was unclear, and that the next election would be fought over who the public trust to fix the cost of living crisis and public services.""At the moment, they think that's Labour. For the Conservatives to stand a chance, they need to change that perception, and it's hard to imagine how bringing David Cameron back does that,"" he said.

 Mideast powers play complex politics amid raging Gaza war ,"
                        
                        
                        As Israeli troops effectively cut the Gaza Strip in two at the weekend, striking several hundred targets every day and cutting off communications, the Royal Jordanian Air Force was negotiating with both Israel and the United States to fly a C-130 transport plane across the enclave dropping aid.Images released by Jordan‚Äôs military showed US-made GPS-guided parachutes being used to ensure medical and other supplies accurately reached their target, a Jordanian-run field hospital reportedly swamped by casualties.But they were also clearly intended to have a political message, to act as an expression of Jordanian and wider Arab anger and determination.Jordan's King Abdullah has warned the conflict risks pushing the entire region to ""the brink of the abyss"", demanding a humanitarian ceasefire and solution to the conflict without forcing Palestinians out of Gaza into neighbouring nations.Jordan and Israel might have managed to cooperate over the weekend flight, but otherwise Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs government appears a long way from halting the offensive, now digging deep into tunnels used by Hamas.Israel says strikes have been precise and included measures to minimise civilian fatalities, but Gaza health authorities say the death toll there is now more than 10,500, 40% of them children.Saudi Arabia says ending the conflict will be a major focus of an emergency weekend Arab and Islamic summit in Riyadh, a meeting that will be attended by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. It follows weeks of shuttle diplomacy by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.The meeting will likely seek to pressure the United States to restrain Israel further, although the effectiveness of such calls may be limited in the short term. The meeting will also showcase the effectiveness or otherwise of long-running US efforts to normalise relations between Gulf Arab states and Israel, together with a parallel rival Chinese effort to do likewise between the same nations and Iran.But for now at least, most governments in the region appear to be looking to strike a balance between intensified popular regional fury against Israel and avoiding further conflict.The most likely scenario appears to be that fighting will continue, perhaps for weeks or months. On Tuesday, Netanyahu described Israeli forces as operating in areas of Gaza City Hamas ""never thought they would"", while Israeli officials talked of removing the group‚Äôs ability to lead the enclave and suggested Hamas's Gaza leader, Yahya Sinwar, was ""isolated"" in a bunker.Whether killing Sinwar will be enough to assuage the Netanyahu government‚Äôs highly public thirst for vengeance for the 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, killed on Oct. 7 remains unclear. Some supporters of his government would clearly like a return to outright occupation, or at the very least what Netanyahu calls an ‚Äúindefinite‚Äù role for Israel in securing Gaza. But few in the wider region, Washington or Europe view that as a sustainable long-term endgame.This week, the United Arab Emirates announced it intended to open its own field hospital in Gaza. Along with further airdrops, that would give regional nations a foothold in the fight ‚Äì and also any post-war settlement ‚Äì while avoiding more direct involvement.  AVOIDING MASS DISPLACEMENTWho else might govern Gaza if Hamas is removed remains unclear. The US appears to favour the Palestinian Authority which already administers the West Bank and briefly ran Gaza before Hamas seized the strip in 2007. But it remains broadly unpopular with Palestinians themselves, as is Hamas.A fully or partially internationally administered solution might be an option, although who might be prepared to offer troops or lead the effort is similarly unclear.For now, the nations meeting in Riyadh have one immediate objective ‚Äì to deter Israel from attempting to drive large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza into the Egyptian-controlled Sinai. Such a move, they fear, might prove permanent, potentially setting the scene for evicting Palestinians from the West Bank into Jordan.Jordanian officials have publicly warned they would consider such a move an act of war. Egyptian counterparts have been less blunt, while regional media is abuzz with rumours that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is under pressure from both Israel and the West to open Egypt‚Äôs borders to a large number from Gaza, with financial incentives and IMF support potentially used to sweeten such an option.Such a forced population movement has long been favoured by right-wing Israeli voices but would be hugely unpopular in the region, inevitably compared to the permanent mass displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation known to Palestinians as the Nakba, or ""catastrophe"".US President Joe Biden has spoken to Sisi several times since the conflict started, with the Egyptian leader warning any efforts to push large numbers of Palestinians into Egypt would be rejected by the Egyptian state and population and would lead to Egyptian territory being used as a springboard for attacks on Israel.For now, however, the US focus appears to be to avoid immediate and serious escalation, particularly by Iranian proxy groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.CHINESE DIPLOMACYThe arrival of the submarine USS Florida, capable of launching more than 100 cruise missiles, further beefs up an already overwhelming US military package of two aircraft carriers and multiple other combat aircraft including A-10 tank busters, enough to dominate any conflict if it chose.Over the last decade, successive US administrations and Israel have quietly built up relations with almost all Gulf Arab nations, particularly those that have sought common ground with both Washington and the Jewish state when it comes to managing Iran. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain formalised relations with Israel with the 2020 Abraham Accords, which Saudi officials had also been expected to sign imminently before the Oct. 7 Hamas assault on southern Israel.The emergence of a firmly anti-Iranian bloc, however, has been dented by the parallel Chinese effort to engage Gulf states with Iran, particularly Saudi Arabia, which along with the UAE is now seen as keen to find a way out of its long-running proxy war in Yemen with Iran.The government in Tehran has its own domestic crises and appears to have very limited appetite for wider confrontation. While Beijing‚Äôs influence with Tehran is likely limited, China is almost certainly also pushing for restraint ‚Äì while retreating oil prices in recent weeks suggest markets are becoming less concerned about an immediate wider war.Last week, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned that avoiding such a war depended on stopping the Israeli assault on Gaza. But the actual activities of the Iran-backed group along the Israeli border with southern Lebanon appear to have been kept deliberately localised, avoiding the scale of cross-border violence seen during the most recent larger conflict there in 2006.Iran-backed militia in Iraq and Syria have stepped up attacks on US forces, particularly with drones, while Houthi militia in Yemen appear to have launched missiles towards Israel, including some shot down by a US destroyer in the Red Sea.As with Hezbollah, however, those actions appear to have been set at a level just short of significantly escalating the conflict ‚Äì and well short of that which might prompt Washington to hit out at Iran directly.Whether or not Iran had advance warning of the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 is unclear ‚Äì but if it didn't, Iran‚Äôs leaders may yet prove unwilling to drag the region into a much wider war to help Hamas weather Israel's military onslaught.Ongoing hostage negotiations with Israel brokered by Qatar alongside others could even allow a few Hamas elements to cut a deal with authorities in Israel, potentially allowing them to flee into exile or perhaps even play a future role in Gaza.This war will still yield more bloodshed, but all players will already be looking to shape things to their advantage when it is over.

 Europe's record gas stocks start to pressure prices ,"
                        
                        
                        Europe's record gas inventories continue to climb even higher as a warm start to autumn delays the onset of heating demand while high prices discourage industrial use and encourage continued imports.But prices for gas delivered at the height of winter in January 2024 have started to slide as the record levels of inventory weigh on the market.Prices for January 2024 fell below 47 euros on Nov 6 from more than 57 euros 10 trading days earlier as traders anticipate winter weather may not be enough to prevent a record carryover of stocks at the end of March 2024.Inventories across the European Union and United Kingdom hit a record 1,146 terawatt-hours (TWh) on Nov 5, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe.Stocks were 189 TWh (+20% or +1.96 standard deviations) above the prior 10-year seasonal average and the surplus had increased from 168 TWh (+18% or +1.70 standard deviations) on Oct. 1.Part of the reason is that Northwest Europe has experienced a mild start to the autumn with temperatures at Frankfurt in Germany 3.5¬∞C above the long-term average in September and 2.5¬∞C in October.At the same time, futures prices and calendar spreads have remained strong, despite record stocks, discouraging resumption of industrial use and encouraging continued imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).After-adjusting for inflation, front-month futures averaged 47 euros per megawatt-hour (88th percentile for all months since the start of the century) in October up from 30 euros (61st percentile) in July.In real terms, front-month prices were around 2.5 times higher than the five-year average for 2016-2020 making spot gas purchases very expensive.Most industrial users buy on contracts linked to calendar average prices but even the futures strip for 2024 averaged 52 euros in October up from less than 20 euros before Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.The persistence of high spot and forward prices have ensured industrial gas use remains well below pre-invasion levels.STORAGE OUTLOOKEurope's storage sites were 99.6% full on Nov 5, a record for the time of year, or any time of year, and gas has continued to be added later than usual owing to the warm weather.Between 2012 and 2022, the median date on which storage peaked was Oct. 26 but this year it was still climbing as late as Nov. 5, making it one of the latest fills on record.Over summer, calendar spreads weakened significantly and the market moved into a significant contango to encourage more consumption and limit the inventory build.Since then, however, spreads have strengthened as traders have been able to store extra gas in Ukraine and on LNG carriers off the coast to avoid storage space running out.More recently, conflict in the Middle East and the possible disruption of gas imports has helped keep European prices high.Europe still needs to conserve gas this winter but given how much is now in storage there is almost no chance stocks will fall critically low whatever the weather.Based on the current storage level and historical depletions over the last decade, inventories are projected to fall to around 575 TWh before the end of winter 2023/24 leaving storage sites 50% full.At this early point in the winter heating season, there is still significant uncertainty about average temperatures and the amount of depletion ahead.But even with a very cold winter, inventories are very unlikely to fall below 368 TWh (32% full), and if the winter is mild they could end as high as 795 TWh (69% full).

 G7's political relevance at stake over Israel-Gaza response ,"
                        
                        
                        The Group of Seven (G7) bloc of wealthy democracies risks eroding its relevance as a force to tackle major geopolitical crises over an apparent struggle between its member nations to agree on a firm, united approach to Israel's war in Gaza.Foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the European Union and the United States meet in Tokyo this week to discuss the conflict, which several global powers have warned could spiral and engulf the Middle East.If ministers do issue a communique after the meeting, it will likely address the conflict in general terms, reflecting the different concerns, and the divergent political and economic loyalties within the group, analysts say.G7 foreign ministers meet in Tokyo Nov 7-8Joint statement on spiralling war in focusChair Japan has struck cautious tone on conflict""Europeans are divided and this division is also certainly visible within the G7,"" said Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of International Relations.Complicating matters is that the current chair of the group Japan has taken a cautious approach to the crisis, resisting pressure to fall in line with the pro-Israel stance of its closest ally, the United States, officials and analysts say.Officials from France and Canada, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the strong US support for Israel, and concerns about a backlash from either Arab or Jewish segments of the populations of the G7 nations, have made reaching common positions challenging.From the beginning of the conflict, Japan has sought a ""balanced"" response, in part due to its diverse diplomatic interests in the region and its dependency on the Middle East for oil.Israeli diplomats, however, have intensively lobbied Japan in phone calls, emails and visits to Japanese officials, according to two sources familiar with the matter.The mounting casualties in Gaza have reinforced Japan's cautious approach, analysts say. Health officials in the Palestinian enclave say almost 10,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed since Israel's bombardment began in retaliation for Oct. 7 attacks by the militant group Hamas.""I don't think ever in the past history of the G7 presidency under Japan it has come to this kind of a critical challenge,"" said Koichiro Tanaka, a professor at Tokyo's Keio University who specialises on international relations in the Middle East.A spokesperson for Japan's foreign ministry said it was expected that countries have different positions, but denied that G7 members were struggling to find common ground.The spokesperson declined to confirm whether a communique would be issued. A statement issued by G7 trade ministers from a meeting in Osaka late last month did not mention the war.DIVISIONS ON DISPLAYThe G7 was initially set up half a century ago to discuss global economic problems, but its scope has since broadened to represent the collective voice of major industrialised countries' on political and security issues.While the group in recent years has shown unity in sanctioning Russia over its Ukraine war and calling out so-called 'economic coercion' from China, they have not moved in lock step over the Israel-Gaza war.Since the war erupted, the G7 has issued just one joint statement on the conflict amounting to a few sentences. Other group members have issued joint statements.G7 divisions have also been evident at the United Nations, with France voting in favour of a resolution calling for a humanitarian truce in the conflict on Oct 26, the US opposing it and the group's other members abstaining.Agreeing specific wording on Israel's right to defend itself, the civilian casualties in Gaza and calls for a temporary halt in fighting will be difficult, officials say.Aside from rhetoric, Hideaki Shinoda, a professor at Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, said the G7 needed concrete proposals on how to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, where fuel, food, water and medical supplies are scarce, but that is also likely to prove a tall task.Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas after the Iran-backed group attacked southern Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 240 hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected global calls for a humanitarian ceasefire, saying any lull would play into the hands of Hamas, while the United States has proposed temporary, localised pauses in the fighting.One G7 official said members were deliberately trying to hide their differences so as not to ""play into Russia's hands"".China and Russia are using the conflict as an opportunity to burnish their credentials as the champions of the developing world, as well as to oppose the United States.Any sign of disunity or failure to stem the conflict may only embolden these G7 detractors, analysts say.""It's also a question of how China and Russia will interpret these developments and how they will try testing us,"" said Kunihiko Miyake, research director at The Canon Institute for Global Studies, a Tokyo-based think tank.*Additional reporting by Reuters correspondents Tim Kelly and Yoshifumi Takemoto in Tokyo, John Irish in Paris, Andrew Gray in Brussels, Andreas Rinke in Berlin, David Brunstromm in Washington DC and Steve Scherer in Ottawa; Editing by Miral Fahmy

" As baby boomers retire, German businesses turn to robots ","
                        
                        
                        At machine parts producer S&D Blech, the head of the grinding unit is retiring. With Germany's acute labour shortage leaving few candidates to take on the skilled but dirty and hazardous manual work, the company will replace him with a robot.Other small and medium-sized companies are also turning to automation as the gradual exit from the workplace of Germany's post-war ""baby boom"" generation tightens the labour squeeze.Some 1.7 million German jobs were unfilled in June, official data shows. The German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) says more than half of companies are struggling to fill vacancies, at an estimated cost to growth in Europe's largest economy of nearly 100 billion euros ($109 billion) per year.Managing director Henning Schloeder cited that trend to explain S&D Blech's push over several years towards automation and digitalisation, saying: ""This will further aggravate the already difficult skilled labour situation, particularly in production and crafts.""Finding a new head of the grinding unit was hard ""not only because of all the experience he has, but also because it's a back-breaking job that no one wants to do any more"", Schloeder told Reuters.Machine-grinding involves high heat and continuous noise, while the sparks it throws out can be dangerous.More women working and a surge in immigration have helped compensate for demographic changes in recent years in Germany.But with baby boomers retiring and a new cohort - much smaller, due to low birth rates - joining the labour force, the Federal Employment Agency expects the pool of workers to shrink by 7 million people by 2035.With similar shifts affecting other developed economies, the impact of advanced automation technologies from robotics to AI will be widely felt, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at global payrolls and HR services provider ADP.""Long term, all those innovations are a game-changer for the world of work. Everybody will do their job differently,"" she told Reuters.Heavy investment in automation by car makers and other industrial giants means Germany is already the world's fourth-biggest market for robots, and the largest in Europe.But as robots become cheaper and easier to operate, the often family-run Mittelstand companies that are the country's economic backbone are also using them, from manufacturers like S&D Blech to bakeries, laundries and supermarkets.According to the International Federation of Robotics around 26,000 units were installed in Germany last year - a figure surpassed only in 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic slowed what had been an average of 4% annual growth.""Robots enable the survival of companies that see their future at risk due to staff shortages,"" said Ralf Winkelmann, managing director of FANUC Germany, which sells about half its Japanese-made robots to small and medium-sized enterprises.Ralf Hartdegen, whose consulting firm guides firms through this type of transition, said companies keen to automate but reluctant to fire people were increasingly basing their plans around the shedding of workers through retirement.Family-run ROLEC, which produces systems to protect industrial electronics and control equipment, bought its first robot last year, to allow production to continue at night. The company has already acquired a second machine and plans to continue investing in automation.""It is great when you turn on the light in the morning and the parts are in the storage container and have been processed,"" CEO Matthias Rose told Reuters. Increasing automation also reflects the fact that robots have become easier to use, with no programming skills required. Most now come with a Human Machine Interface, a touchscreen similar to a smartphone, said Florian Andre, a co-founder of SHERPA Robotics, a start-up that focuses on companies with between 20 and 100 employees.Even workers and trade unions, once fearful of job losses, take an increasingly positive view. A survey published by robots marketplace automatica in June found nearly half of German employees see robots as helping to address labour shortages.ROLEC's Rose said its initial venture into automation in 2022 had come as a big backlog of orders meant employees had to work overtime and on Saturdays. ""It was a good starting situation for our first robot, as it was seen as a helper instead of as competition,"" he added.A spokesperson for Germany's powerful IG Metall trade union said robots adopted as part of a long-term corporate strategy, rather than to cut costs quickly, can help make work ""healthier, more interesting and safer"".Lorry and bus manufacturer Daimler Truck DTGGe.DE makes extensive use of robotics, particularly to help with heavy lifting and other challenges to workers' physical health.""But there is nothing more flexible than a human,"" said Matthias Krust, head of the company's works council.""The more complex the production, the more differentiated, the harder it becomes to use robots.""*Maria Martinez is a Reuters correspondent in Berlin covering German economics and the ministry of finance.

 Samsung launches slimmest smartphone as it races against rival Apple ,"
                        
                        
                        Samsung Electronics made public on Tuesday its slimmest flagship model to date, complete with enhanced artificial intelligence features, as it seeks to get ahead of rival Apple in the premium market.
The S25 Edge launch is designed to tap increasing demand, especially from consumers in their 20s and 30s, for more portable smartphones.
""The feedback was clear ‚Äì users wanted something slimmer and easier to carry without sacrificing performance,"" said Samsung, which made structural changes to reduce the thickness of internal components, including the printed circuit board and thermal systems.
Analysts said the launch was strategically timed to pre-empt Apple, which is expected to launch a thinner iPhone in the second half of this year.
""By releasing the product a few months ahead, Samsung could inflict some impact on Apple and attract consumers looking for thinner smartphones. It appears to be a calculated decision to capture that segment of demand,"" said Ryu Young-ho, a senior analyst at NH Investment & Securities.
The S25 Edge will go on sale in South Korea on May 23 and in the United States on May 30, Samsung said, adding it will roll it out to about 30 countries, including China and in Europe.
Starting at $1,099, the model has a 6.7-inch (170 mm) screen and a 5.8 millimetre-thick body, making it larger than the basic S25 model but only fractionally heavier.
The S25 Edge includes Samsung's latest built-in AI functions, including multimodal AI that allows users to interact with the device in real time through vision and voice, using the camera to ask questions.
Samsung did not disclose the production site for the new model.
At the launch event, Samsung dismissed concerns about potential performance and heat management issues with the device.
""Some may worry that a thinner phone compromises performance or struggles with heat management,"" said Samsung Electronics Executive Vice President Moon Sung-hoon.
""We managed to engineer a thinner vapor chamber to fit the slim design, and we put everything into making that happen. We‚Äôre confident the S25 Edge can be used without concerns about overheating,"" said Moon.
Samsung became the world‚Äôs leading smartphone vendor in the first quarter of 2025, capturing 20 percent of the global market and narrowly surpassing Apple, which held a 19 percent share, data from Counterpoint Research showed.
Samsung last month, however, said second-quarter shipments could be affected if tariff risks weaken demand.

A critical issue is how much equity in OpenAI‚Äôs new for-profit business Microsoft will receive in exchange for the more than $13 billion it has invested in the company to date, the report said.

They are also revising terms of a wider contract, first drafted when Microsoft initially invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019, the report said.

Microsoft declined to comment on the report. OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

 Google settles Black employees' racial bias lawsuit for $50m ,"
                        
                        
                        Google has agreed to pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the search engine company of systemic racial bias against Black employees.

A preliminary settlement covering more than 4,000 Google employees in California and New York was filed on Thursday evening in the Oakland, California federal court, and requires a judge's approval.

Plaintiffs in the proposed class action said Google has a ""racially biased corporate culture"" where management steers Black employees to lower-level jobs, pays them less, downgrades their performance ratings and denies them opportunities to advance.

According to the complaint, Black employees comprised only 4.4 percent of Google's workforce and 3 percent of its leadership in 2021.

The plaintiff April Curley, hired to expand outreach to historically Black colleges, said Google denied her promotions, stereotyped her as an ""angry"" Black woman, and fired her after six years as she prepared a report on its alleged racial bias.

Managers also allegedly denigrated Black employees by declaring they were not ""Googley"" enough or lacked ""Googleyness,"" which the plaintiffs called racial dog whistles.

Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet, denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, and said it fully complied with all applicable laws.

 Texas secures $1.38bn settlement with Google over data privacy ,"
                        
                        
                        Google has agreed to pay $1.375 billion in a settlement in principle reached with the state of Texas over allegations the company violated users' data privacy, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Friday.

The agreement settles two lawsuits that covered three products for allegedly violating Texas consumer protection laws.

‚ÄúIn Texas, Big Tech is not above the law. For years, Google secretly tracked people‚Äôs movements, private searches and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won,‚Äù said Paxton in a statement.

Details of the settlement were not disclosed.

The Texas attorney general did not say how the money would be used.

Google said the agreement settles claims encompassing Incognito, Location History and biometrics-related allegations. The company did not admit any wrongdoing.

‚ÄúThis settles a raft of old claims, many of which have already been resolved elsewhere, concerning product policies we have long since changed,"" said a statement from Jos√© Casta√±eda, a Google spokesperson. ""We are pleased to put them behind us, and we will continue to build robust privacy controls into our services.‚Äù

Paxton sued Google twice in 2022, alleging that it had collected from Texas residents records of their face geometry and voiceprints without obtaining proper consent. He also alleged the company tracked users' location even when they thought they had disabled the feature and misled users about Incognito mode, which is meant to provide private browsing.

The settlement does not require product changes, according to a Google spokesperson.

Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, agreed last year to pay $1.4 billion to settle with Paxton over allegations it unlawfully collected and used facial recognition data.

 China's AI-powered humanoid robots aim to transform manufacturing ,"
                        
                        
                        In a sprawling warehouse in a Shanghai suburb, dozens of humanoid robots are manoeuvred by their operators to carry out tasks like folding a T-shirt, making a sandwich and opening doors, over and over again.

Operating 17 hours a day, the site's goal is to generate reams of data that its owner, Chinese humanoid startup AgiBot, uses to train robots it hopes will become ubiquitous and change the way humans live, work and play.

""Just imagine that one day in our own robot factory, our robots are assembling themselves,"" said Yao Maoqing, a partner at AgiBot.

The importance of humanoid robots to Beijing, as it looks for solutions to pressing issues including trade frictions with the US, population decline, and slowing growth, was underscored when Chinese President Xi Jinping inspected AgiBot's robots in Shanghai last month. Xi jokingly remarked during the visit that perhaps the machines could play in a football team.

Another domestic developer of humanoid robots, Unitree, was also present in a meeting Xi hosted for private firms earlier this year, where he urged them to help China's economy.

As the US negotiates with China over tariffs that President Donald Trump had imposed to help bring back US manufacturing jobs, Beijing is aiming for a new industrial revolution where many factory tasks would be performed by humanoid robots.

In recent years, Chinese humanoid robots have demonstrated increasing feats of agility, including performing somersaults, running a half-marathon, and even playing football, as Xi mused.

But Reuters is reporting for the first time details about how China's advances in artificial intelligence, partly driven by the success of homegrown firms like DeepSeek as well as abundant government support, are allowing humanoid developers to pair the robots' already impressive hardware with the software needed to make them economically valuable.

Reuters spoke to more than a dozen people, including Chinese humanoid manufacturers, investors, customers and analysts, who described how breakthroughs in developing robot ""brains"" will allow these metallic machines to go from mere spectacles to productive and autodidact workers that could revolutionise the world's pre-eminent manufacturing power.

China aims to build its edge by focusing on data training and the sophistication of its AI models, the people said, with some saying the prowess of DeepSeek was a big aid.

DeepSeek and the Chinese government didn't respond to requests for comment about their roles in the development of humanoid robots.

A successful and widespread deployment of these robots in factory floors would enable China to keep driving economic growth and maintain its manufacturing superiority, making the field an area of competition with the US

Less clear is how Beijing would manage the spectre of layoffs of factory workers. State media has suggested that, as with previous industrial revolutions, long-term job creation would outweigh short-term pain.



GOVERNMENT SUPPORT

Chinese authorities are handing out generous subsidies for humanoid firms. More than $20 billion has been allocated to the sector over the past year, and Beijing is establishing a one trillion yuan ($137 billion) fund to support startups in areas such as AI and robotics, official announcements show.

The government is also a key buyer, according to a Reuters review of hundreds of tender documents. State procurement of humanoid robots and related tech jumped to 214 million yuan in 2024 from 4.7 million yuan in 2023.

Other state support includes a newly created 10 billion yuan AI and robotics fund by the southern city of Shenzhen.

Humanoid robot makers and component suppliers based in Wuhan are eligible for subsidies of up to 5 million yuan after reaching thresholds for procurement and sales targets, as well as free office space.

Beijing's municipal government created a robotics fund in 2023 that offered up to 30 million yuan for companies looking to accelerate construction of their first products.

Some analysts predict that humanoids could follow the trajectory of electric vehicles, whose costs tumbled dramatically over the past decade as manufacturers rushed in and government subsidies spurred widespread adoption among the Chinese public.

The average bill of materials for a humanoid will be about $35,000 by the end of this year but could fall to $17,000 by 2030 if most of it is sourced from China, said Ming Hsun Lee, head of Greater China automotive and industrial research at Bank of America Securities, in a research note.

Three Chinese humanoid manufacturers told Reuters they predicted a similar halving of costs, perhaps within a year. In comparison, the component cost for Tesla's Optimus robots, if all of their major parts are sourced from outside China, is currently $50,000 to $60,000, Lee added in the note. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.

""With its comprehensive supply chain, China has an edge in lowering the humanoid robot production cost significantly,"" Lee told Reuters, estimating that global humanoid robot annual sales could reach 1 million units in 2030. ""This industry is still in its baby boom stage.""



AI AND DATA

The Chinese government is also investing heavily in data collection, which several executives said was the industry's main pain point but also an area where China had an advantage.

In comparison to generative AI, where tech companies have trained foundation models by drawing from massive online datasets of text, pictures and audio, the supply of data necessary to train AI models used to run humanoid robots, also known as embodied AI platforms, is far smaller.

Humanoids need to interact with a physical environment and train on datasets focused on tasks, such as stacking boxes or pouring water into a cup.

Last year, Shanghai authorities assisted in setting up AgiBot's data collection site, providing premises rent-free where about 100 robots operated by 200 humans work every day.

AgiBot's facility enables it to collect high-quality, targeted data, which it can use to train its embodied AI model, said Yao.

Similar sites are being built by governments in Beijing and Shenzhen, according to announcements.

Widening deployment of humanoids, especially into factories, is likely to accelerate data collection.

MagicLab, another humanoid startup, said in an interview that its focus on the robots' brains has allowed it to recently begin deploying prototypes in production lines for tasks such as quality inspection, material handling, and assembly.

""These breakthroughs lay the foundation for our focus in 2025 on real-world applications,"" said CEO Wu Changzheng, adding that MagicLab has integrated its robots with AI models like DeepSeek, Alibaba's Qwen, and ByteDance's Doubao.

""DeepSeek has been helpful in task reasoning and comprehension, contributing to the development of our robots' ‚Äòbrains‚Äô.‚Äù

China's clearest advantage, however, is its domination of the hardware that makes up a humanoid. The country is capable of making up to 90 percent of humanoid components, lowering barriers to entry, according to analysts and startups.

As a result, China now accounts for the majority of manufacturers working on such projects globally and dominates the supply chain, according to Morgan Stanley. Some Chinese startups are selling robots as cheaply as 88,000 yuan ($12,178).

""If you have a requirement in the morning, suppliers might come to your company with materials or products by the afternoon, or you can go directly to their site to see for yourself,"" said Zhang Miao, chief operating officer of Beijing-based startup CASBOT.

""It's difficult to achieve this level of efficiency overseas,"" she added, as companies would need to import materials from China.

The sector has seen an explosion of new firms. In 2024, 31 Chinese companies unveiled 36 competing humanoid models versus eight by US companies, according to Morgan Stanley.

At least six companies in China, including market leaders Unitree and UBTech 9880.HK, have said they have entered mass production or are preparing to do so this year.



JOBS AT RISK?

While the industry remains incipient, Chinese lawmakers have begun to discuss the far-reaching implications intelligent humanoid robots could have for the workforce.

Some 123 million people work in manufacturing in China, according to a 2023 survey by the National Bureau of Statistics.

At this year's National People's Congress, social security expert Zheng Gongcheng warned that the development of robots and AI would affect around 70 percent of China's manufacturing sector, which could lead to a steep decline in social security contributions.

At the same gathering, Liu Qingfeng, chairman of domestic AI firm iFlytek, suggested the creation of an AI unemployment insurance program that would provide six to 12 months of coverage for workers replaced by robots.

Tang Jian, chief technology officer at the government-backed Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Beijing robot half-marathon in April that its prototypes were targeting jobs that humans don't want to do due to their boring or repetitive nature, as well as dangerous tasks.

Despite concerns about the impact on jobs, Beijing sees the technology as key to plug labour shortages in areas such as elderly care, where demand is increasing as China's 1.4 billion population ages.

China's government published a national elderly-care plan in December that encouraged integration of humanoid robots and AI. Soon after, tech giant Ant Group announced the creation of new subsidiary Ant Lingbo Technology, whose humanoid robots will focus on elderly care, among other areas.

""The robots in five or 10 years could organise a resident's room, pick up a package or even transfer people from a bed to a washroom,"" said AgiBot's Yao.

 Apple's plan to offer AI search options on Safari a blow to Google dominance ,"
                        
                        
                        Apple's plans to add AI-powered search options to its Safari browser are a big blow to Google, whose lucrative advertising business relies significantly on iPhone customers using its search engine.

The news slammed shares of Google-parent Alphabet, which closed down 7.3%, wiping off roughly $150 billion from its market value.

The iPhone maker was ""actively looking at"" reshaping Safari, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, citing Apple executive Eddy Cue who was offering testimony at an antitrust case on Wednesday over Google's dominance in online search.

Cue said searches on Safari fell for the first time last month due to users increasingly turning to AI, according to the source. Apple stock closed down 1.1%.

Google said that it continued to see growth in the overall number of search queries, including ""total queries coming from Apple's devices and platforms,"" according to a statement posted on the company's blog.

""People are seeing that Google Search is more useful for more of their queries ‚Äî and they‚Äôre accessing it for new things and in new ways,"" the company wrote.

Google cited voice and visual search features as contributors to total search volume growth. It was unclear whether Cue was using the same basis of comparison in his testimony when analysing types of searches.

Still, the Apple executive's comments suggests that a seismic shift in search is likely underway, threatening Google's dominant search business - a go-to advertising destination for marketers that has now become a target for US antitrust regulators, which filed two major lawsuits against the company.

Google is the default search engine on Apple's browser, a coveted position for which it pays the iPhone maker roughly $20 billion a year, or about 36% of its search advertising revenue generated through the Safari browser, analysts have estimated.

Banning Google from paying companies to be the default search engine is among the remedies that the U.S. Justice Department has proposed to break up its dominance in online search.

""The loss of exclusivity at Apple should have very severe consequences for Google even if there are no further measures,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.

""Many advertisers have all of their search advertising with Google because it is practically a monopoly with almost 90% share. If there were other viable alternatives for search, many advertisers could move much of their ad budgets away from Google,"" Luria said.

Google is not defenceless.

Written off as an also-ran in the AI race by critics after ChatGPT's buzzy launch in late 2022, Google has reached into its deep pockets to fund its AI efforts and leverage its vast data trove.

The company introduced an ""AI mode"" on its search page earlier this year, looking to retain its millions of users from going away to other AI models.

It recently expanded AI Overviews - summaries that appear atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages on a search query - for users in more than 100 countries, and added advertisements to feature, boosting Search ad sales.

CEO Sundar Pichai said in a testimony at an antitrust trial last month that Google hopes to enter an agreement with Apple by the middle of this year to include its Gemini AI technology on new phones.

Apple's Cue on Wednesday also said the company would add AI search providers, including OpenAI and Perplexity AI, as search options in the future, Bloomberg reported.

""(Apple's plan) also shows how far generative search sites, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity have come,"" said Yory Wurmser, principal analyst for advertising, media & technology at eMarketer.

That Google is willing to pay tens of billions of dollars to remain the default search engine shows how crucial the agreements are, Wurmser said.

For instance, ChatGPT in April reported seeing over 1 billion weekly web searches for its search feature. It has more than 400 million weekly active users, as of February.

 US calls EU fines on Apple and Meta 'economic extortion' ,"
                        
                        
                        The White House said on Wednesday that fines on Apple AAPL.O and Meta Platforms META.O by the European Union were a ""novel form of economic extortion"" that the United States will not tolerate.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Apple was fined 500 million euros ($570 million) on Wednesday and Meta 200 million euros, as EU antitrust regulators handed out the first sanctions under landmark legislation aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech.

The fines were seen as a development that could stoke tensions between the EU and U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to levy tariffs against countries that penalize American companies.

CONTEXT

The White House on Wednesday called the legislation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), discriminatory.

The fines followed a year-long investigation by the European Commission, the EU executive, into whether the companies comply with the DMA that seeks to allow smaller rivals into markets dominated by the biggest companies.

KEY QUOTES

""This novel form of economic extortion will not be tolerated by the United States,"" a White House spokesperson said.

""Extraterritorial regulations that specifically target and undermine American companies, stifle innovation, and enable censorship will be recognized as barriers to trade and a direct threat to free civil society.""

 Google contemplated exclusive Gemini AI deals with Android makers ,"
                        
                        
                        Alphabet's Google contemplated deals with Android phone makers such as Samsung last year that would provide exclusivity for not only its search app, but also for its Gemini AI app and Chrome browser, according to a document shown at the second day of an antitrust trial.

The US Department of Justice and a broad coalition of state attorneys general are seeking an order from a judge in Washington that would require Google to sell its Chrome browser and take other measures. They hope to end what the judge found was Google's monopoly in online search and related advertising.

In that ruling, US District Judge Amit Mehta found that Google protected its search monopoly through exclusive agreements with Samsung Electronics and others to have its search engine installed as the default on new devices.

Instead of entering more exclusive agreements, however, Google recently loosened its deals with device makers Samsung and Motorola and wireless carriers AT&T and Verizon, allowing them to load rival search offerings, according to documents shown at trial.

The non-exclusive agreements mirror what Google has said should be the remedy to address Mehta's ruling. The DOJ wants the judge to go farther, banning Google from making lucrative payments in exchange for installation of its search app.

Google sent the company letters as recently as last week reiterating that their agreements did not prohibit the companies from installing other AI products on new devices, Google executive Peter Fitzgerald testified.

Prosecutors raised concerns in opening statements on Monday that Google's search monopoly could give it advantages in AI, and that its AI products are another way to lead users to its search engine.

OpenAI's ChatGPT head of product Nick Turley took the stand on Tuesday. He is expected to testify about how Google's exclusive agreements make it harder to distribute AI products such as ChatGPT.

Google has said the case is not about AI, and that it faces robust competition from companies including Meta Platforms.

                        Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, the chief advisor‚Äôs special assistant on ICT, has called on operators to reduce mobile internet prices.

In a Facebook post on Monday, he wrote, ‚ÄúThe government has already provided mobile operators with DWDM [Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing] and dark fibre facilities. 

‚ÄúWith this support, private mobile companies do not have a valid excuse not to lower internet prices.‚Äù

Noting that reducing mobile internet costs could offer some relief amid ongoing high inflation, he added: ‚ÄúThe government has extended policy support to mobile network operators and, through public-private partnerships, reduced wholesale internet rates at both national and international levels. Now it‚Äôs their turn to contribute to this national initiative.‚Äù

Pointing out that internet prices have already been lowered across multiple tiers, Taiyeb wrote: ‚ÄúAll that remains is for the three private mobile service providers to announce similar reductions in their prices.‚Äù

He went on to add that internet prices are being reduced at three new levels. 

According to him, Fiber@Home management has confirmed price reductions of 10 percent at the ITC level, 10 percent at the IIG level, and 15 percent at the NTTN, or National Transmission level.

When asked for comment, Abbas Faruque, chief government and regulatory affairs officer at Fiber@Home, said: ‚ÄúThe government is working to deliver high-quality internet at affordable prices to the people, and we are a part of that journey. We want to ensure that the best service reaches people‚Äôs doorsteps.‚Äù

Taiyeb also noted, ‚ÄúPreviously, the ISP Association had guaranteed 10 Mbps internet at Tk 500 instead of 5 Mbps. Before that, Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company reduced prices at the international gateway level by 10 percent for all IIGs and ISPs, and an additional 10 percent for wholesale customers, amounting to a total reduction of 20 percent.‚Äù

He expressed hope that the three private mobile operators would soon announce a reasonable reduction in mobile internet prices.

According to him, ‚ÄúThe government expects two types of price reductions: First, to reverse the price hike mobile operators implemented in March, citing SRO adjustments. Even after the government rolled back the increased tariff, the operators did not adjust prices accordingly.‚Äù

‚ÄúSecond, to implement price cuts at a consumer level that reflect the reduced wholesale prices at the international gateway/ITC, IIG, and national transmission levels.‚Äù

Grameenphone, the country‚Äôs largest mobile operator by the number of users, did not comment on potential price reductions when asked by bdnews24.com.

Ankit Sureka, head of external communications at Grameenphone, told bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúInternet pricing does not depend on a single factor. It involves multiple elements across the value chain: spectrum, towers, fibre, electricity, and more, and final pricing is based on the combined cost of all these components.‚Äù

‚ÄúNonetheless, we are prioritising our customers, and evaluating methods to offer them high-quality service at a lower price.‚Äù

Sureka also pointed to the high corporate tax rate in the telecommunications sector as a significant contributor to the high cost of mobile internet.

bdnews24.com is still awaiting responses from Robi and Banglalink regarding the government‚Äôs call to reduce internet prices.

Taiyeb concluded his statement by addressing ongoing concerns about the quality of mobile internet in Bangladesh, saying: ‚ÄúPrices here are disproportionately high compared to the quality of service.

 Google faces trial in US bid to end search monopoly ,"
                        
                        
                        Alphabet's Google faces a historic trial on Monday as US antitrust enforcers in Washington seek to force the tech giant to sell off its Chrome browser as part of a bid to restore competition to the market for online search engines.

The outcome of the trial could fundamentally reshape the internet by unseating Google as the go-to portal for information online. The US Department of Justice hopes it will prevent Google's dominance from extending to artificial intelligence.

DOJ attorney David Dahlquist said during his opening statement that DOJ officials were present in the courtroom to show that the case, started under Trump and carried forward under Biden, has ""the full support of the DOJ both past and present.""

Google plans to appeal the final ruling in the case.

""When it comes to antitrust remedies, the US Supreme Court has said that 'caution is key.' DOJ's proposal throws that caution to the wind,"" Google executive Lee-Anne Mulholland said in a blog post on Sunday.

Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater rejected that assessment in remarks outside the courthouse on Monday morning.

""You know what is irresponsible? Leaving Google's monopoly abuse unaddressed,"" she said.

US District Judge Amit Mehta is overseeing the three-week trial.

The US Department of Justice and a coalition of 38 state attorneys general have proposed far-reaching measures designed to quickly open the search market and give new competitors a leg up.

Their proposals include ending exclusive agreements in which Google pays billions of dollars annually to Apple and other device vendors to make Google the default search engine on their tablets and smartphones.

Google would also have to license search results to competitors, among other requirements. And it would be made to sell its Android mobile operating system if other remedies fail to restore competition.

Prosecutors have said they expect testimony about how Google's agreements to be the default search engine on mobile devices have hampered distribution efforts by artificial intelligence companies. Witnesses from Perplexity AI and OpenAI are expected to take the stand.

Google sees the proposals as extreme, and said the court should stick to limiting the terms of its default agreements.

The $1.9 trillion tech company has been subsidising browser makers such as Mozilla by paying to remain the default search engine. Cutting off that financial support could threaten their existence, Google says. And ending payments to device makers would raise the cost of smartphones, the company claims.

Google plans to call witnesses from Mozilla, Verizon and Apple, which launched a failed bid to intervene in the case.

Few potential buyers of Chrome have the same incentive as Google to maintain the free open-source code that underpins it, and which others including Microsoft use as a basis for their own browsers, the company says.

The trial comes on the heels of a win for the DOJ in a Virginia court on Thursday where a judge ruled in a separate antitrust case that Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology.

Meta Platforms is currently facing its own antitrust trial over the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.

 China pits humanoid robots against humans in half-marathon ,"
                        
                        
                        Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km course.
The robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidVP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.
Some firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.
""The robots are running very well, very stable ... I feel I'm witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,‚Äù said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.
The robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.
A few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words ""Bound to Win"" in Chinese.
Some robots completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.
Although humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.
China is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.
Alan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires ""AI breakthroughs"", the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.
""(The robot half-marathon) is more of a hardware endurance demonstration,"" he said.
""Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.
""Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don't demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,"" Fern said.

                        Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a key concession at a US antitrust trial on Tuesday, saying he bought Instagram because it had a ""better"" camera than the one his company was trying to build for flagship app Facebook at the time.

The acknowledgement appeared to bolster allegations by US antitrust enforcers that Meta had used a ""buy or bury"" strategy to snap up potential rivals, keep smaller competitors at bay and maintain an illegal monopoly.

It came during Zuckerberg's second day testifying at the high-stakes trial in Washington, in which the US Federal Trade Commission is seeking to unwind Meta's acquisitions of prized assets Instagram and WhatsApp.

The case, filed during President Donald Trump's first term, is widely seen as a test of the new Trump administration's promises to take on Big Tech companies.

Asked by an attorney for the FTC whether he thought fast-growing Instagram could be destructive to Meta, then known as Facebook, Zuckerberg said he believed Instagram had a better camera product than Facebook was building.

""We were doing a build vs. buy analysis"" while in the process of building a camera app, Zuckerberg said. ""I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.""

Zuckerberg also acknowledged that many of the company's attempts at building its own apps had failed.

""BUILDING A NEW APP IS HARD""

""Building a new app is hard and many more times than not when we have tried to build a new app it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,"" Zuckerberg told the court.

""We probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company and the majority of them don't go anywhere,"" he said.

Zuckerberg's testimony comes as Meta is defending itself years after the release of damning statements plucked from Facebook's own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said ""it is better to buy than compete.""

The company argues that his past intentions are irrelevant because the FTC has defined the social media market inaccurately and failed to account for stiff competition Meta has faced from ByteDance's TikTok, Alphabet's YouTube and Apple's messaging app.

The FTC accuses Meta of holding a monopoly on platforms used to share content with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap's Snapchat SNAP.N and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016.

Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC argues.

" Meta to use public posts, AI interactions to train models in EU ","
                        
                        
                        Meta Platforms said on Monday it would use interactions that users have with its AI, as well as public posts and comments shared by adults across its platforms, to train its artificial intelligence models in the European Union.

The Facebook parent's move comes after Meta launched its AI technology in Europe last month, a roll-out that was initially announced in June 2024 but delayed following regulatory concerns on data protection and privacy.

While Meta AI was launched in the US in 2023, its roll-out in Europe faced several hurdles due to the EU's stringent privacy and transparency rules.

Meta said on Monday people in the EU who use its platforms including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp will start receiving notifications explaining what kind of data the company will harness. Users will also receive a link to a form where they can object to their data being used for training purposes.

While the company will use data such as user queries and questions on Meta AI, private messages as well as public data from accounts of users under the age of 18 will not be used in the training.

The European Commission did not respond to a request for comment on Meta's move.

Meta decided to pause the launch of its AI models in Europe last June after Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) told the company to delay its plan to harness data from social media posts. It also faced backlash from advocacy group NOYB, which urged national privacy watchdogs to stop such use of social media content.

Elon Musk's X and Alphabet's Google are also being looked into by the Irish privacy regulator.

X is facing an investigation over the use of EU users' personal data to train its AI system, Grok, while the DPC opened a probe into Google in September on whether the company adequately protected users' data before using it to help develop its AI model.

" Trump spares smartphones, computers, other electronics from China tariffs ","
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump's administration granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China, providing a big break to tech firms like Apple that rely on imported products.

China said it was evaluating the impact of the exclusions. In a statement on Sunday, the Ministry of Commerce called the move a ""small step by US to correct its wrong practice of unilateral 'reciprocal tariffs'.""

""The bell on a tiger's neck can only be untied by the person who tied it,"" the ministry said, urging the U.S. to make a major step in correcting what it called its wrongdoing and cancelling the tariffs completely.

In a notice to shippers late on Friday, the US Customs and Border Protection agency published a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, with retroactive effect from 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on April 5.

It featured 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays.

The notice gave no explanation for the move, but the exclusion provides welcome relief to major technology firms such as Apple, Dell Technologies and many other importers.

The action also excludes the specified electronics from Trump's 10 percent ""baseline"" tariffs on goods from most countries other than China, easing import costs for semiconductors from Taiwan and Apple iPhones produced in India.

Asked on Saturday about his reasoning for the exemptions and plans for semiconductors, Trump told reporters: ""I'll give you that answer on Monday. We'll be very specific on Monday ... we're taking in a lot of money, as a country, we're taking in a lot of money.""

For the Chinese imports, the exclusion of the tech products applies only to Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which climbed to 125% this week, according to a White House official. Trump's prior 20 percent duties on all Chinese imports that he said were related to the US fentanyl crisis remain in place.

But the official said Trump would launch a new national security trade investigation into semiconductors soon that could lead to other new tariffs.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called the announcement about the tech exclusions ""the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend.""

""There is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations.... Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,"" Ives said in an industry note.

Beijing increased its own tariffs on US imports to 125 percent on Friday, hitting back against Trump's decision to further raise duties on Chinese goods and increasing the stakes in a trade war that threatens to upend global supply chains.

On Wednesday, Trump had announced a reprieve for levies on dozens of countries while ratcheting up tariffs on Chinese imports effectively to 145 percent.

Many tech company CEOs have embraced Trump as he begins his second term, attending his Jan 20 inauguration and celebrating with him afterward. Apple CEO Tim Cook hosted a pre-inaugural ball and has visited Trump at his home in Florida.

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Trump has made clear the US cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.

But she said that at Trump's direction, major tech firms, including Apple and chipmakers Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor ""are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.""


TARIFF PAIN

The exemptions suggest an increasing awareness within the Trump administration of the effect of his tariffs on US consumers who are weary of inflation.

Even at a lower 54 percent tariff rate on Chinese imports, analysts predicted the price of a top-end Apple iPhone could jump to $2,300 from $1,599. At 125 percent, economists and analysts have said US-China trade could largely halt.

Smartphones were the top US import from China in 2024, totaling $41.7 billion, while Chinese-built laptops were second, at $33.1 billion, according to US Census Bureau data.

Apple recently chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the US from India, after it stepped up production there in an effort to beat Trump's tariffs, Reuters reported on Friday.

Trump's White House campaign last year focused on a vow to bring down prices. But he also promised to impose the tariffs that he views as essential to realigning the world trading order and he has dismissed turbulence in financial markets and price increases from the levies as a necessary disturbance.

His so-called ""reciprocal tariffs,"" however, have raised fears of a US recession and have drawn criticism from some of his fellow Republicans, who do not want to lose control of Congress in next year's mid-term elections.

Trump told reporters on Friday he was comfortable with the high tariffs on China but had a good relationship with President Xi Jinping and believed something positive would come out of the trade conflict between them.

His tariff moves have caused turmoil on financial markets. US stocks ended a volatile week higher, but the safe haven of gold hit a record high during the session and benchmark US 10-year government bond yields posted their biggest weekly increase since 2001 alongside a slump in the dollar, signaling a lack of confidence in the US.

 Starlink's commercial satellite internet service set to begin after final approval ,"
                        
                        
                        Starlink's satellite internet service is approaching its commercial launch in Bangladesh, with the government‚Äôs approval process now in its final stages.
Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun confirmed that the approval process is in its final phase.
Speaking at a press conference on Sunday at the Foreign Service Academy in Dhaka, Ashik said the satellite internet service would begin full-scale operations once Starlink receives the Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit (NGSO) licence, for which the company is expected to apply on Sunday.
""The next step is obtaining the NGSO licence, and they will likely apply today. We aim to issue the licence as soon as they apply, following our rules and regulations. Once granted, they can begin commercial operations the very next day,"" he added.
The process to launch Starlink's services in Bangladesh gained momentum after a phone call between Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus and SpaceX founder Elon Musk on Feb 14.
Following the discussion, steps were taken to launch the service in the country.
On Mar 9, Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, the Special Assistant to the chief advisor on Telecommunication and Information Technology, announced that local companies had begun working on the establishment of the ground earth station for Starlink‚Äôs services.
The interim government has signed several collaboration agreements with Starlink, assisting with land allocation, construction, and infrastructure maintenance for the project.
Ashik also confirmed that on Apr 9, during the Investment Conference, Starlink‚Äôs trial service would begin at the InterContinental Dhaka hotel.
This marks a significant milestone as part of the broader plan to bring high-speed satellite internet services to the country.
On Mar 29, Yunus instructed the company to launch Starlink‚Äôs satellite broadband internet service in Bangladesh within 90 days.
The statement also mentioned that while Starlink would use foreign satellite gateways for trial broadcasting, the company would comply with NGSO regulations and use local broadband gateways or Internet Exchange Providers (IXP) when offering commercial services in the country.
During the briefing, Ashik provided updates on the commercial rollout of Starlink‚Äôs services, saying: ‚ÄúAfter obtaining the NGSO licence, Starlink can proceed with its operations. They‚Äôve completed the registration process with BIDA and are on track for commercial service.‚Äù
He added that Starlink‚Äôs devices might take some time to arrive, and the company will decide on their operational model.
Ashik also shared that the service would be trialled during the summit, with the public and delegates able to access Starlink's internet service via their devices.
When asked about Musk‚Äôs attendance at the conference, he said: ‚ÄúI have not confirmed Elon Musk‚Äôs presence at the summit. After the recent elections in the US, he has become a government official. Bringing him to Bangladesh now would require a formal process.‚Äù
On the security issue related to the situation in the Chattogram Hill Tracts, Ashik emphasised the importance of providing internet access to everyone.
‚ÄúAccess to the internet should be a fundamental right for all, whether in the Chattogram Hill Tracts or Kurigram. Just like access to water and air, everyone should have the right to connect.‚Äù

 Meta releases new AI model Llama 4 ,"
                        
                        
                        Meta Platforms on Saturday released the latest version of its large language model (LLM) Llama, called the Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick.

Meta said Llama is a multimodal AI system. Multimodal systems are capable of processing and integrating various types of data including text, video, images and audio, and can convert content across these formats.

Meta said in a statement that the Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick are its ""most advanced models yet"" and ""the best in their class for multimodality.""

Meta added that Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout will be open source software. It also said it was previewing Llama 4 Behemoth, which it called ""one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet to serve as a teacher for our new models.""

Big technology firms have been investing aggressively in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure following the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which altered the tech landscape and drove investment into machine learning.

The Information reported on Friday that Meta had delayed the launch of its LLM's latest version because during development, Llama 4 did not meet Meta's expectations on technical benchmarks, particularly in reasoning and math tasks.

The company was also concerned that Llama 4 was less capable than OpenAI's models in conducting humanlike voice conversations, the report added.

Meta plans to spend as much as $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure, amid investor pressure on big tech firms to show returns on their investments.

" Microsoft, turning 50, dials up Copilot actions to stay in AI game ","
                        
                        
                        Thousands of people swooned in a dark conference hall that felt more like a rock concert when a Microsoft product manager demonstrated the company's latest feature: how to sum numbers in Excel, with the click of a button.
""It was literally like Mick Jagger walked out,"" said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's consumer chief marketing officer, who started as an intern.
That was more than 30 years ago. On Friday, the day Microsoft turned 50, the company's leaders and staff gathered at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, to remember the software maker's glory days while trumpeting what they hope will bring it into the future: more powerful artificial intelligence.
Copilot, Microsoft's AI assistant, is gaining a host of new features to make it more proactive. The version for consumers will start remembering personal facts about them. It will offer birthday reminders or support ahead of a presentation, or consumers can opt out, Mehdi said in an interview.
Copilot likewise will personalise podcasts and shopping recommendations, and it will let consumers task their AI to make reservations for them. ""It frees you up,"" said Mehdi.
Microsoft is hardly first to roll out action-taking or ""agentic"" software. As with rival systems, the AI will work best on popular sites where Microsoft has done some behind-the-scenes technical work, like with 1-800-Flowers.com and OpenTable, Mehdi said.
Mehdi recalled days when Microsoft was smaller and growing. He said CEO Bill Gates could devour three books' worth of information from one day to the next, at a time when the co-founder still worked on Microsoft software. Mehdi watched Steve Ballmer, Gates' eventual successor, chant ""developers, developers, developers!"" in a sweat-drenched shirt to rouse a crowd into the "".net"" era.
Microsoft went from top of the pack to badly bruised in a high-profile lawsuit that US antitrust enforcers brought against it in 1998. Years later, younger companies and startups, among them Alphabet and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, beat it to the punch on key AI developments.
Satya Nadella, Microsoft's current CEO, is not standing still. The leader who turned Microsoft into the No. 2 cloud powerhouse challenged his executives at an internal summit this week, recalled Mehdi: ""How do we rethink the way that we build the software?""
Nadella voiced a similar view at Microsoft's Redmond event on Friday, where he, Gates and Ballmer made a rare joint public appearance. Ballmer reprised his ""developers!"" chant as well.
Nadella said the company was not simply celebrating its past 50 years but creating a future defined by ""what we empower others to build.""
Gates said, ""We're on the verge of something even more profound than what came for those first 50 years."" Asked what he wished for Microsoft at age 100, he said: ""I hope Copilot's a good CEO.""
Microsoft is iterating on its chatbot technology in a crowded field that includes Elon Musk's xAI and Anthropic. It has added Copilot to its heavily used productivity suites for business while giving consumers a distinctive version.
""It's warm; it has that personality,"" said Mehdi. Some users have taken to this, while others find it asks too many questions, he said.
""When we get to now be more personalised, we can start to get smarter,"" Mehdi said. ""We're part way through that journey.""

" DOGE official at DOJ bragged about hacking, distributing pirated software ","
                        
                        
                        A top employee of billionaire Elon Musk who is now working in the US Justice Department previously bragged about hacking and distributing pirated software, according to archived copies of his former websites reviewed by Reuters.


Christopher Stanley, a 33-year-old engineer who has worked at both Musk's social media company X and space-launch company SpaceX, is a senior advisor in the Deputy Attorney General's office, according to a former Justice Department official and a staff directory listing reviewed by Reuters.


Stanley was assigned there while working for Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency that President Donald Trump set up to slash the federal bureaucracy. Musk has said no ""organisation has been more transparent‚Äù than DOGE, but there‚Äôs been little public information on the responsibilities and background of its staff.


Stanley ran a series of websites and forums starting as far back as 2006, when he was 15, registration data preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools shows. Several of those sites distributed pirated ebooks, bootleg software and video game cheats, according to copies maintained by the Internet Archive, a nonprofit whose 'Wayback Machine' preserves old websites.


Stanley boasted about hacking into websites on at least two of the forums, according to archived posts, one of which dates to when he was 19. At the time, he said he had put his hacking days behind him. But a YouTube video he posted in 2014 shows his involvement in the breach of customer data from a rival hacking group, when he was 23.


In response to questions for this story, the Justice Department did not directly address Stanley's current role or his past but said he had an active security clearance that predated his employment at DOGE. In a statement to Reuters, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said she had ""full trust and confidence in Chris‚Äôs ability to help the federal government."" Stanley, the White House, SpaceX and X did not respond to requests for comment.


In the hours after Reuters contacted Stanley, several of his old websites vanished from the Internet Archive. Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, declined to answer specific questions about the disappearance of Stanley‚Äôs websites but said people who own the rights to sites can request to have their URLs excluded from the archive.


National security professionals were largely split on how seriously to take Stanley‚Äôs past. Six former Justice officials told Reuters his background raised red flags, noting that the department handles sensitive information, including details of federal investigations and other information protected by grand jury secrecy rules.


‚ÄúI would have very serious concerns about hiring him in and giving him access to these kinds of records,‚Äù said Jonathan Rusch, who spent more than 25 years as a Justice Department prosecutor before going into academia. Rusch said Stanley‚Äôs background was worrisome, particularly for a Justice Department employee, because he had disclosed data which he had ‚Äúacquired apparently illegally.‚Äù


Dan Guido, whose digital security firm Trail of Bits has worked with the Justice and Defense departments, was more forgiving. Stanley‚Äôs history of hacking shouldn‚Äôt disqualify him from working at the DOJ, he said, citing Stanley‚Äôs youthfulness and the way he targeted other hackers as mitigating factors.


‚ÄúThat is a way I‚Äôve seen a lot of people learn.‚Äù


Reuters could not determine Stanley‚Äôs specific Justice Department responsibilities. The Deputy Attorney General‚Äôs office, run by Trump‚Äôs former private attorney, Todd Blanche, oversees all the US Attorney‚Äôs offices, and manages criminal investigations into a range of offenses, including hacking and other malicious cyber activity.


Reuters also could not establish whether Stanley remains employed by X and SpaceX. On LinkedIn, he still identifies himself as working for them and makes no reference to his Justice Department work. A profile photo on X shows him standing before the emblem for the Office of Justice Programs, an office in the department that awards grant funds. Like Musk, Stanley is classified as a ""special government employee"" and is not drawing a government salary, the DOJ said.


PIRACY, VIDEO GAME CHEATS AND HACKING


Other members of Musk‚Äôs DOGE team have faced scrutiny over their backgrounds.


When Reuters reported last week that DOGE staffer Edward Coristine had previously provided network infrastructure to a gang of cybercriminals, Democrats in the Republican-led House of Representatives Oversight Committee said in a post on X that it was another reason ‚Äúwe need a full investigation into WHO is working for DOGE.‚Äù Coristine has not responded to requests for comment.


Starting about 10 years before joining SpaceX, Stanley ran several online forums that covered software piracy, video game cheats and hacking. He used various pseudonyms on those sites, including eNkrypt and Reneg4d3, both of which he still uses on some social media accounts.


Reuters was able to link the now-defunct forum websites and the usernames to Stanley by cross-referencing the sites‚Äô registration data against his old email address and by matching Reneg4d3‚Äôs biographical data to Stanley‚Äôs.


On some of Stanley's earliest sites, he claimed credit for hacking. The website, fkn-pwnd.com, launched in 2006 while he was in high school, boasted of ‚ÄúFucking Up Servers!‚Äù and featured a crude sketch of a penis, according to a copy of the site preserved by the Internet Archive.


On reneg4d3.com, which he registered the following year, the archives show Stanley described how he hijacked a competing message board. ‚ÄúGot admin access,‚Äù he said in a 2008 post, just before he turned 17, describing the site‚Äôs operators as ‚Äústupid noobs.‚Äù ‚ÄúEasy exploit,‚Äù he wrote.


Around that time, a rival video game-cheating website, rev0lution-cheats.com, was hijacked and defaced with the message: ‚ÄúThis site has been hacked by RENEG4D3.com.‚Äù Reneg4d3.com was suspended by its internet service provider a few months later, according to a screenshot of the site preserved by DomainTools.


Reuters could not corroborate certain aspects of the hacking activity, including the identity of the site Stanley claimed credit for hijacking or the circumstances of rev0lution-cheats‚Äô defacement.


Stanley went on to start other websites where he and other participants discussed hacking, video-game cheating or piracy, including error33.net and electonic.net (sic), the Internet Archive‚Äôs records show.


‚ÄòI NO LONGER HACK‚Äô


At age 19, Stanley distanced himself from malicious cyber activity in an archived 2010 post on electonic.net, writing: ""I no longer hack into Paypals, gain root access into other people's computer (sic), or exploit online websites like StickAM"" ‚Äì an apparent reference to a video streaming service that shut down in 2013.


In that same post, he said he‚Äôd been threatened with a lawsuit by the South Korean gaming company Nexon Co for ""infiltrating their game software and altering certain aspects of the game.""


""They did not take kindly to this,"" he said.


Reuters could not independently corroborate the claims of theft, computer hijacking and software tampering, or the threatened lawsuit. A Nexon spokesperson said the company had been unable to locate any information regarding the matter. PayPal did not respond to a request for comment.


Discussions on the electonic.net forum show that Stanley had not entirely left the hacking world behind. The website ‚Äì like others Stanley had created ‚Äì offered contraband ebooks and ‚Äúwarez‚Äù ‚Äì internet slang for pirated software.


In December 2014, when he was 23, Stanley posted footage of himself carrying out a hack of the customer database connected to Lizard Squad, a hacking group that took credit for several high-profile outages that included attacks against Sony Corp's PlayStation Network. Reuters was unable to reach former members of Lizard Squad for comment.


Stanley had published the video to his YouTube page, where he went by the Reneg4d3 nickname and used a photo of himself with Elon Musk as his profile picture. Shortly after this story was published, the video was set to private and the page became unavailable.

                        Nintendo is set to reveal details of its Switch 2 on Wednesday with investors looking for the pricing and launch date of the successor to the home-portable Switch gaming device.

Analysts expect a smooth transition to the new device with the Kyoto-based company offering upgraded hardware while hewing closely to the form and function of its hit predecessor.

The Switch has sold more than 150 million units, with hardware refreshes and hit games from franchises such as ""Super Mario"" and ""The Legend of Zelda"" extending its lifecycle.

Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal expects the Switch 2 to retail between $399 and $499 and be launched in May to June.

""Once the Switch 2 goes on sale, we believe the strength of demand will become evident,"" Goyal wrote in a client note.

The Switch, which transformed Nintendo's fortunes after the Wii U sold poorly, launched in March 2017 priced at $299.99.

The company will provide details of the Switch 2 at a Nintendo Direct event.

 Ghibli effect: ChatGPT usage hits record after rollout of viral feature ,"
                        
                        
                        The frenzy to create Ghibli-style AI art using ChatGPT's image-generation tool led to a record surge in users for OpenAI's chatbot last week, straining its servers and temporarily limiting the feature's usage.

The viral trend saw users from across the globe flood social media with images based on the hand-drawn style of the famed Japanese animation outfit, Studio Ghibli, founded by renowned director Hayao Miyazaki and known for movies such as ""Spirited Away"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro"".

Average weekly active users breached the 150 million mark for the first time this year, according to data from market research firm Similarweb.

""We added one million users in the last hour,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an X post on Monday, comparing it with the addition of one million users in five days following ChatGPT's red-hot launch more than two years ago.

Active users, in-app subscription revenue and app downloads reached an all-time high last week, according to SensorTower data, after the AI company launched updates to its GPT-4o model, enabling advanced image generation capabilities.

Global app downloads and weekly active users on the ChatGPT app grew 11 percent and 5 percent, respectively, from the prior week, while in-app purchase revenue increased 6 percent, the market intelligence firm said.

However, the chatbot has been hit with a series of glitches and low-scale outages over the past week as it deals with a spike in traffic due to the popularity of its image-generating tool.

""We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,"" the OpenAI co-founder said on Tuesday.

LEGAL UNCERTAINTY

The extensive use of the AI tool for the Ghibli effect has also led to questions about potential copyright violations.

""The legal landscape of AI-generated images mimicking Studio Ghibli's distinctive style is an uncertain terrain. Copyright law has generally protected only specific expressions rather than artistic styles themselves,"" said Evan Brown, partner at law firm Neal & McDevitt.

OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the data used to train its AI models and the legality surrounding its latest feature.

Studio Ghibli co-founder Miyazaki's comments from 2016 on AI-generated images resurfaced after the trend blew up last week.

""I am utterly disgusted,"" Miyazaki had said after being shown an early render of an AI-generated.

                        OpenAI and Meta Platforms have held separate discussions with India's Reliance Industries over potential partnerships to expand their artificial intelligence offerings in the country, technology news website The Information reported on Saturday.

A possibility being discussed involved a relationship between Reliance Jio and OpenAI to distribute ChatGPT, according to The Information, which cited two sources familiar with the matter.

OpenAI also discussed with employees cutting the ChatGPT subscription price to as low as several dollars instead of $20 a month, according to the report, which added that it is not clear if OpenAI has discussed the idea of price reduction with Reliance.

Reliance has discussed selling OpenAI's models to its enterprise customers through an application programming interface or API, The Information report added, saying that the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate also discussed hosting and running OpenAI models locally, so the data of local customers can be kept within India.

In particular, Reliance has discussed running the Meta and OpenAI models in a three-gigawatt data center that the company is planning to build, which it has said is the largest data center in the world, located in the city of Jamnagar in Gujarat.

" Google, Apple hit by EU regulatory crackdown ","
                        
                        
                        Google was hit with two charges of breaching landmark EU rules on Wednesday, while Apple was ordered to help rivals connect with its iPhones and iPads, as Europe's antitrust regulators continued a crackdown against Big Tech.

The move by the European Commission came despite threats from US President Donald Trump to levy tariffs against countries which impose fines on US companies.

Both Google and Apple have been in the European Commission's crosshairs since March last year over concerns that they may not be complying with the Digital Markets Act, which aims to rein in the power of Big Tech via a list of do's and don'ts.

The EU competition watchdog on Wednesday issued preliminary findings charging Google with DMA violations in both areas, confirming a Reuters story from Feb 21.

The Google case centred on whether it restricts app developers from informing users about offers outside its app store Google Play, and whether it favours its associated search services such as Google Flights in Google Search.

The Commission also issued two orders to Apple to open up its ecosystem to rivals, six months after it began so-called specification proceedings against the iPhone maker.

The first charge in the Google case focused on the company's practices on its app store Google Play. Alphabet technically prevents app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels for better offers, regulators said.

A service fee charged by the company for facilitating an app developer's initial acquisition of a new customer via Google Play goes beyond what is justified, they added.

In the second charge, regulators said Google favoured its own services such as Google Shopping, Google Hotels and Google Flights over rivals.

EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement that the measures ""ensure that Alphabet abides by EU rules when it comes to two services widely used by businesses and consumers across the EU, Google Search and Android phones"".

Google pushed back, saying that EU competition rules are hurting consumers and businesses.

""The Commission's findings require us to make even more changes to how we show certain types of Search results, which would make it harder for people to find what they are looking for and reduce traffic to European businesses,"" Oliver Bethell, Google's senior director for competition, said in a blogpost.

If the company cannot charge reasonable fees to support the ongoing development of Android and the Play services, it cannot invest in an open platform, he said.

The first EU order against Apple requires the company to give rival makers of smartphones, headphones and virtual reality headsets access to its technology and mobile operating system so they can connect with iPhones and iPads seamlessly.

The second sets out a timeline for Apple to respond to requests from app developers for its systems to be interoperable with others.

Apple said the EU order would hurt users and help its rivals.

""Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules,"" the company said in an email.

""It's bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users,"" it added.

Google, which has been fined more than 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) by the EU in the last decades for various antitrust violations, risks fines of up to 10 percent of its global annual sales if found guilty of breaching the DMA.

Apple could face an investigation and potential fine if it fails to comply with Wednesday's order.

Alphabet shares were up 1% at 1540 GMT. Apple shares were up 1.6%.

 Nvidia CEO says power-saving optical chip tech will need to wait for wider use ,"
                        
                        
                        A promising new chip technology that aims to cut energy usage is not yet reliable enough for use in Nvidia's flagship graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said Tuesday.

Co-packaged optics, as the emerging technology is called, uses beams of laser light to send information on fiber optic cables between chips, making connections faster and with superior energy efficiency to those through traditional copper cables.

During a keynote address to Nvidia's annual developer conference at a packed hockey stadium in San Jose, California on Tuesday, Huang said his company would use the co-packaged optical technology in two new networking chips that sit in switches on top of its servers, saying the technology would make the chips three and a half times more energy efficient than their predecessors.

The switch chips will come out later this year and into 2026 in a small but significant step toward advancing the technology.

But Huang told a group of journalists after his speech that while Nvidia examined using it more widely in its flagship GPU chips it had no current plans to do so, because traditional copper connections were ""orders of magnitude"" more reliable than today's co-packaged optical connections.

""That's not worth it,"" Huang said of using optical connections directly between GPUs. ""We keep playing with that equation. Copper is far better.""

Huang said that he was focused on providing a reliable product roadmap that Nvidia's customers, such as OpenAI and Oracle, could prepare for.

""In a couple years, several hundred billion dollars of AI infrastructure is going to get laid down, and so you've got the budget approved. You got the power approved. You got the land built,"" Huang said. ""What are you willing to scale up to several hundred billion dollars right now?""

Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors have pinned their hopes on the optics technology, which they believe will be central to building ever-larger computers for AI systems, which Huang said on Tuesday would still be necessary even after advances by companies like DeepSeek because AI systems would need more computing power to think through their answers.

Startups such as Ayar Labs, Lightmatter and Celestial AI have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital - some of it from Nvidia itself - to try and put co-packaged optical connections directly onto AI chips. Lightmatter and Celestial AI are both targeting public offerings.

Copper connections are cheap and fast, but can only carry data a few meters at most. While that might seem trivial, it has had a huge impact on Nvidia's product lineup over the past half decade.

Nvidia's current flagship product contains 72 of its chips in a single server, consuming 120 kilowatts of electricity and generating so much heat that it requires a liquid cooling system similar to that of a car engine. The flagship server unveiled on Tuesday for release in 2027 will pack hundreds of its Vera Rubin Ultra Chips into a single rack and will consume 600kw of power.

Cramming more than double the number of chips into the same space over two years will require massive feats of engineering from Nvidia and its partners. Those feats are driven by the fact that AI computing work requires moving a lot of data back and forth between chips, and Nvidia is trying to keep as many chips as it can within the relatively short reach of copper connections.

Mark Wade, the CEO of Ayar Labs, which has received venture backing from Nvidia, said the chip industry was still navigating how to manufacture co-packaged optics at lower costs and with higher reliability. While the transition may not come until 2028 or beyond, Wade said, the chip industry will have little choice but to ditch copper if it wants to keep building bigger and bigger servers.

""Just look at the power consumption going up and up on racks with electrical connections,"" Wade told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of Nvidia's conference. ""Optics is the only technology that gets you off of that train.""

 Europol warns of AI-driven crime threats ,"
                        
                        
                        Organised crime gangs are turning to AI-powered scams and payment systems to target victims, allowing them to rapidly and more cheaply scale up operations globally and making them harder to detect, Europol warned on Tuesday.

The technology means they can craft messages in multiple languages and create highly realistic dupes to impersonate individuals and blackmail targets in global cyberfraud operations, the law enforcement agency of the EU said in its European Serious Organised Crime Threat Assessment report.

Criminals are also using generative artificial intelligence to produce child sexual abuse material, it said.

""The very DNA of organised crime is changing. Criminal networks have evolved into global, technology-driven criminal enterprises, exploiting digital platforms, illicit financial flows, and geopolitical instability to expand their influence,"" Catherine De Bolle, Europol‚Äôs executive director, said.

The agency said elements of every criminal process were increasingly moving online, including recruitment, communication and payment systems.

""The same qualities that make AI revolutionary - accessibility, adaptability, and sophistication - also make it a powerful tool for criminal networks,"" Europol said.

""These technologies are automating and expanding criminal operations, making them more scalable and harder to detect.""

The report warned that the emergence of fully autonomous AI, in which systems plan and execute tasks without human guidance, ""could pave the way for entirely AI-controlled criminal networks, marking a new era in organised crime"".

In late February, Europol announced the arrest of two dozen people for distributing AI-generated child abuse images.

The operation was one of the first involving AI-generated child abuse material, Europol said at the time, adding there was a lack of national legislation surrounding the use of AI tools for this purpose.

In early December, it said it had taken down an encrypted messaging service MATRIX that was used for international drug and arms trafficking.

Europol on Tuesday listed cyber attacks, migrant smuggling, drug and firearms trafficking and wrongdoing in waste management among the fastest growing criminal threats on the continent.

 Intel's new CEO plots overhaul of manufacturing and AI operations ,"
                        
                        
                        Intel's incoming CEO Lip-Bu Tan has considered significant changes to its chip manufacturing methods and artificial intelligence strategies ahead of his return to the company on Tuesday, two people familiar with Tan's thinking told Reuters, in a sweeping bid to revive the ailing technology giant.

The new trajectory includes restructuring the company's approach to AI and staff cuts to address what Tan views as a slow-moving and bloated middle management layer. Revamping the company's manufacturing operations, which at one time only made chips for Intel but have been repurposed to make semiconductors for outside clients such as Nvidia, is one of Tan's core priorities, these sources said.

The plans are still being formulated and could yet change, these sources said.

Intel shares rose more than 8% in mid-day trading on Nasdaq.

At a town hall meeting following his appointment as CEO last week, he told employees that the company will need to make ""tough decisions,"" according to two other people briefed on the meeting.

Semiconductor industry expert Dylan Patel said a big problem under former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who left the company in December, was that he was ""too nice."" ""He did not want to fire a bunch of middle management in the way they needed to,"" he said.

Tan, 65, former CEO of chip design software firm Cadence and tech investor, was a member of Intel's board until he resigned last August. In returning as CEO, Tan is set to take over the American icon after a decade of bad decisions by three CEOs in which it failed to build chips for smartphones and missed surging demand for AI processors, allowing competitors Arm Holdings and Nvidia to dominate those markets.

Intel reported an annual loss of $19 billion in 2024, its first since 1986.

In the near term, Tan aims to improve performance at its manufacturing arm, Intel Foundry, which makes chips for other design companies such as Microsoft and Amazon, by aggressively wooing new customers, according to the people.

It will also restart plans to produce chips that power AI servers and look to areas beyond servers in several areas such as software, robotics and AI foundation models.

""Lip-Bu will be spending a lot of time listening to customers, partners and employees as he comes on board and works closely with our leadership team to position the business for future success,"" an Intel spokesman said in a prepared statement.

Intel declined to comment further or make Tan available for an interview. Tan's venture firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to requests for comment.

At the outset, Tan's strategy appears to be a fine-tuning of that of Gelsinger. The centerpiece of Gelsinger's turnaround plan was to transform Intel into a contract chip manufacturer that would compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, or TSMC, which counts Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm as customers.

Gelsinger committed tens of billions of dollars to build factories in the U.S. and Europe to make chips for both Intel and for outside customers, but he was forced to scale back those ambitions as the market for Intel's core products cooled.

BETTING ON AI

Tan has been a vocal internal critic of Gelsinger's execution, according to the two sources familiar with Tan's plans.

For most of its history, Intel has manufactured chips for only one client - itself. When Gelsinger became CEO in 2021, he prioritized manufacturing chips for others but fell short of providing the level of customer and technical service as rival TSMC, leading to delays and failed tests, former executives have told Reuters.

Tan's views were shaped by months of reviewing Intel's manufacturing process after the board in late 2023 appointed him to a special role overseeing it, according to a regulatory filing.

In his assessment, he expressed frustration with the company's culture, sources told Reuters, saying it had lost the ""only the paranoid survive"" ethos enshrined by former CEO Andy Grove. He also came to believe that decision-making was slowed down by a bloated workforce, Reuters reported.

Tan presented some of his ideas to Intel's board last year, but they declined to put them into place, according to two people familiar with the matter. By August, Tan abruptly resigned over differences with the board, Reuters reported.

When he returns as CEO this week, he will lay fresh eyes on Intel's workforce, which was slashed by roughly 15,000 to almost 109,000 at the end of last year, the sources said.

Beyond the cuts, Tan has little choice but to make Intel's existing manufacturing operation work in the short run. Intel's next generation of advanced chips equipped with AI features, called Panther Lake, will depend on its in-house factories using a new set of techniques and technologies Intel calls ""18A.""

Intel's financial success this year is tied to strong sales of the forthcoming chip.

Tan signalled in a memo Intel published Wednesday that he plans to keep control over the factories, which remain financially and operationally separate from the design business and restore Intel's position as a ""world-class foundry.""

Intel's contract manufacturing operation can succeed if Tan wins over at least two large customers to produce a high volume of chips, industry analysts and Intel executives told Reuters.

Part of the effort to lure large customers will involve improving Intel's chip manufacturing process to make it easier for potential customers like Nvidia and Alphabet‚Äôs Google to use.

Intel has demonstrated improvements in its manufacturing processes in recent weeks and has attracted interest from Nvidia and Broadcom that have launched early test runs, Reuters reported. Advanced Micro Devices is also evaluating Intel's process.

Tan is expected to work on ways to improve output or ""yield"" to deliver higher numbers of chips printed on each silicon wafer as they move to volume manufacturing of its first in-house chip using the so-called 18A process this year.

The goal is to move to an annual release schedule of AI chips, similar to Nvidia, but that will take years. It will be at least 2027 before Intel can develop a compelling new architecture for a first AI chip, according to three industry sources, and one person familiar with Intel‚Äôs progress.

Billionaire Elon Musk and OpenAI jointly proposed a trial in December, according to a federal court filing on Friday.
The parties agreed to delay a decision on whether the expedited case will be decided by a jury or solely by the judge, said the filing in US District Court for the Northern District of California.
The judge this month denied Musk's request to pause the artificial intelligence group's transition to a for-profit model but agreed to an expedited trial in the autumn, the latest turn in the high-stakes legal fight.
""We welcome the court's Mar 4 decision rejecting Elon Musk's latest attempt to slow down OpenAI for his personal benefit,"" OpenAI said in a blog post on Friday.
Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 but left before the company took off and subsequently founded the competing startup xAI in 2023.
Last year, the CEO of Tesla and owner of the X social media platform sued OpenAi and Altman, accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission ‚Äî to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit.


OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations, while Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor.
At stake in the lawsuit is the ChatGPT maker's transition to a for-profit model, which the startup says is crucial to raising more capital and competing well in the expensive AI race.
OpenAI‚Äôs last fundraising round, of $6.6 billion, and a new round of up to $40 billion under discussion with SoftBank Group, are conditioned on OpenAI restructuring to remove the nonprofit‚Äôs control.
Friday's filing comes weeks after Altman, who has said OpenAI is not for sale, rejected a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium with a ""no thank you.""

                        NASA and SpaceX hope on Friday to launch a long-awaited crewed rocket that will let them bring home US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, stuck on the International Space Station for nine months.

SpaceX and the US space agency had planned to launch a replacement crew of four astronauts from Florida on Wednesday, a mission called Crew-10, but a last-minute problem with the rocket's ground systems forced a delay.

NASA on Thursday said SpaceX had resolved the issue - flushing a suspected pocket of air out of a hydraulic clamp arm - and that the weather was 95 percent favourable for a Friday launch.

Slated for liftoff at 7:03pm ET Friday (2330 GMT), the Crew-10 will reach the ISS on Saturday night.

Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, two veteran NASA astronauts and US Navy test pilots, became the first humans to test-fly Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to the ISS.

But problems with Starliner's propulsion system during the flight forced an extension of their planned eight-day stay as NASA deemed it too risky for them to fly home on the craft, which returned to Earth empty.

The mission has also become entangled in politics as President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, SpaceX's CEO, say without evidence that former president Joe Biden left the astronauts on the station for political reasons.

""We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short,"" Wilmore said, adding that he did not believe NASA's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics.

""That's what your nation's human spaceflight programme's all about,"" he said, ""planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.""

NASA says they have had to remain on the ISS to maintain its minimum staffing level.

Having seen their mission turn into a normal NASA rotation to the ISS, Wilmore and Williams have been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the other astronauts.

""UNUSUAL"" FLIGHT PREPARATION PROCESS

Trump and Musk's demand for an earlier return was an unusual intervention, and NASA brought forward the Crew-10 mission from Mar 26, swapping a delayed SpaceX capsule for one that would be ready sooner.

The pressure from Musk and Trump has hung over a NASA preparation and safety process that normally follows a well-defined course.

NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said SpaceX's ""rapid pace of operations"" had required NASA to change some of the ways it verifies flight safety.

The agency had to address some ""late breaking"" issues, NASA space operations chief Ken Bowersox told reporters, including investigating a fuel leak on a recent SpaceX Falcon 9 launch and deterioration of a coating on some of the Dragon crew capsule's thrusters.

Bowersox said it was hard for NASA to keep up with SpaceX: ""We're not quite as agile as they are, but we're working well together.""

When the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore, Williams and two others - NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov - can return to Earth in a capsule that has been attached to the station since September, as part of the prior Crew-9 mission.

If Crew-10 launches as planned on Friday, it will dock to the ISS at 11:30pm ET Saturday(0330 GMT Sunday), followed by a traditional handover ceremony that will allow for the Crew-9 crew's departure on Mar 19.

 Intel's new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has a history as a successful underdog ,"
                        
                        
                        Lip-Bu Tan may be one of the most powerful technology executives you've never heard of. As he steps into one of the highest-profile jobs on the planet, CEO of troubled, storied chipmaker Intel, his performance will be on full display.

Tan, named Intel CEO on Wednesday, faces an enormous challenge in turning around the operations of a company that put the ""silicon"" in Silicon Valley.

While little known to the public, his advantage is that virtually every one of Intel's former and potential customers knows him and has done business with him, either buying one of the many startups he backed or using software from a company he ran.

Tan rubs shoulders with the likes of Lisa Su from Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, two AI chip leaders who, according to Reuters reports, had been pitched to invest in Intel. His efforts are also likely to be closely watched by US President Donald Trump, who is eager for Intel to rebound.

Tan ""can leverage his experience and especially his industry connections, while also pursuing excellence within Intel,"" said independent analyst Jack Gold. ""Hopefully the board will stay out of his way as he makes needed changes.""

Shares of Intel were up more than 10% in premarket trading on Thursday.

LEAN OPERATOR

To right the semiconductor industry's biggest ship, Tan, 65, may use underdog strategies that helped him turn around smaller companies that later became big.

Born in Malaysia, raised in Singapore and now a naturalised American citizen, Tan came to the US for his formative years of advanced education, studying nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then moved to California for business school and founded venture capital firm Walden International in 1987. That firm, named for the pond where writer Henry David Thoreau sought an unconventional life, made unconventional bets.

Tan believed that relatively small teams of startup engineers with good chip design ideas could successfully compete against incumbent chip giants, and he poured money into hundreds of startups. For example, he took a stake in Annapurna Labs, a startup later purchased by Amazon.com for $370 million that has become the heart of its in-house chip division. Amazon says it now deploys more of its own central processors than it does those from Intel.

He also invested in Nuvia, which Qualcomm bought for $1.4 billion in 2021, making it a central part of its push to compete with Intel in the laptop and PC chip markets.

Tan remains actively involved with startups that could either become competitors or acquisition targets for Intel.

For example, earlier this week he invested in AI photonic startup Celestial AI, which is backed by Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices.

Both as an investor and CEO, Tan was early to recognise a major trend that has swept the chip industry over the past 30 years - that designing chips and manufacturing them would split into two different specialties.

Tan from 2009 to 2021 was CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a chip design software firm whose fortunes he revived. Tan focused Cadence around supplying the software for sophisticated designs and partnered closely with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW, which from its founding days swore it would focus only on manufacturing.

Over Tan's time at Cadence, the firm's stock appreciated 3,200 percent and it landed Apple as one of its largest customers as the iPhone maker shifted away from suppliers such as Intel and toward its own chips.

Cadence's tools also became central to chip industry firms such as Broadcom, which helps Google, Amazon and others design their own AI chips and have them made by TSMC.

""He did a really good job of pointing (Cadence) in the right direction,"" said Karl Freund, analyst with Cambrian AI Research. ""Cadence really aligned themselves with TSMC - they saw them as a leader and the go-to shop.""

                        US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that his administration was in touch with four different groups about the sale of Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, and that all options were good.

TikTok's fate has been up in the air since a law requiring its owner ByteDance to either sell it on national security grounds or face a ban took effect on Jan 19. Trump, after taking office on January 20, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law.

Asked if there was going to soon be a deal on TikTok, Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One, ""it could.""

""We're dealing with four different groups, and a lot of people want it ... all four are good,"" he added.

TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment outside of normal business hours.

The turmoil at TikTok has attracted several potential buyers, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who have expressed interest in the fast-growing business analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion.

 Two Russian regions block Telegram app over security fears ,"
                        
                        
                        Authorities in two Russian regions have blocked the Telegram messenger because of concerns that the app could be used by enemies, a regional digital development minister was quoted as saying by the TASS state news agency on Saturday.

Dagestan and Chechnya are mainly Muslim regions in southern Russia where intelligence services have registered an increase in militant Islamist activity.

""It (Telegram) is often used by enemies, an example of which is the riots at the Makhachkala airport,"" said Yuri Gamzatov, Dagestan's digital development minister, adding that the decision to block the messenger had been made at the federal level.

Gamzatov was referring to an anti-Israel riot in Dagestan in Oct 2023, when hundreds of protesters stormed an airport to try to attack passengers arriving on a plane from the Jewish state. No passengers were injured, and authorities have prosecuted several people over the incident.

News of the plane's arrival had spread on local Telegram channels, where users posted calls for antisemitic violence. Telegram condemned the attack and said it would block the channels.

Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the blocks in Russia.

Based in Dubai and founded by Russian-born Pavel Durov, the messenger has nearly 1 billion users and is used widely in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet republics.

Moscow tried but failed to block Telegram in 2018 and has in the past demanded the platform hand over user data. Durov is under formal investigation in France as part of a probe into organised crime on the app.

Gamzatov, the minister in Dagestan, said Telegram could be unblocked in the future, but encouraged users to switch to other messengers in the meantime.

 Apple says some AI improvements to Siri delayed to 2026 ,"
                        
                        
                        Some artificial intelligence improvements to Apple's voice assistant Siri will be delayed until 2026, the company said on Friday.
In a statement, Apple said it has ""been working on a more personalised Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.""
Apple did not give a reason for the delays. The iPhone maker had previously indicated the features would come in 2025.
Last year, Apple announced a range of AI-driven features called Apple Intelligence that included new capabilities such as rewriting emails and summarizing a cluttered inbox.
Some of the biggest improvements were aimed at giving its Siri assistant the ability to duck in and out of apps and complete tasks for a user by tapping into information stored on Apple devices.
Apple gave examples such as asking Siri to pull up a podcast recommended by a friend or pulling up flight tracking information from a relative, all based on data held on the device.
The company has been building a vast new cloud computing infrastructure that runs on its own chips in an effort to maintain its privacy stance while delivering AI features. Apple has said Siri fields 1.5 billion user requests per day.
Apple's rivals have also been rushing to add AI features to their voice assistants, with Alphabet's Google adding its Gemini model to its assistant last year.
Amazon last month rolled out an AI-driven overhaul of its Alexa assistant, saying that the new capabilities would be free for subscribers to its Prime programme but cost $19.99 a month otherwise.

 Google tests an AI-only version of its search engine ,"
                        
                        
                        Alphabet's Google launched an experimental version of its search engine on Wednesday that completely eliminates its classic 10 blue links in favour of an AI-generated summary.

The new feature, available to subscribers of Google One AI Premium, can be accessed via the results page for any search query by clicking on a tab labelled ""AI Mode"" to the side of existing options like Images and Maps.

""We've heard from power users that they want AI responses for even more of their searches,"" Robby Stein, a vice president of product, said in a blog post.

Google One AI Premium is a $19.99 per month plan that provides extra cloud storage and special access to some AI features.

Google currently displays AI Overviews, summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, for users in more than 100 countries. It began adding advertisements to AI Overviews last May.

With AI Mode, users see a more comprehensive AI summary with hyperlinks to cited webpages. The 10 blue links have been replaced by a search bar for asking follow-up questions.

Google said AI Mode is being powered by a custom version of its Gemini 2.0 model with reasoning capabilities that make it better equipped to handle complex queries.

Alphabet's $350 billion in 2024 revenue was primarily driven by search-related advertising. But it is facing the biggest challenge to its core business in years from AI challengers led by Microsoft-backed MSFT.O OpenAI, which added search functions to ChatGPT last October.

Google has made integrating AI into search its biggest bet, investment chief Ruth Porat said at the Reuters NEXT conference in December.

In February, edtech company Chegg CHGG.Nsued Google, accusing the previews of eroding demand for original content and undermining publishers' ability to compete.

 Do wireless headphones cause cancer? Experts weigh in on the risks ,"
                        
                        
                        As wireless headphones become an increasingly popular choice for music lovers and commuters alike, many have wondered whether these devices could pose health risks. The primary concern revolves around the radiofrequency (RF) radiation emitted by Bluetooth-enabled headphones, according to the digital lifestyle publication Well+Good.
The health risks associated with RF radiation stem from X-rays and gamma rays, which cause cellular damage due to their high-energy, ionising radiation.
Wireless headphones, on the other hand, emit non-ionising radiation, which is much safer, according to Jana Andrews, MD, chair of radiation medicine at Northwell Phelps Hospital.
However, studies have suggested that wireless headphones may not be entirely risk-free. The WHO‚Äôs International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified RF radiation as a Class 2B Possible Human Carcinogen, meaning it ‚Äúmight‚Äù contribute to cancer.
Other studies have shown that radiation from wireless devices can affect male fertility and cause hearing problems. Long-term exposure to low-intensity radiofrequency radiation may lead to oxidative stress, which is linked to several illnesses, including inflammatory disorders and cancer.
Nevertheless, the majority of these findings apply to all devices that emit RF radiation, not just wireless headphones. The studies do not definitively state that wireless headphones lead to the aforementioned health risks. That is because, unlike ionising radiation, RF waves do not have enough energy to damage DNA.
Despite continued concerns, current research does not give conclusive proof that wireless headphones are harmful when used in moderation. As the discussion continues, many experts advise adopting simple precautions to be on the safe side, such as limiting prolonged use, keeping the volume low, and avoiding wearing headphones while sleeping.

 Skype's final call set for May as Microsoft prioritises Teams ,"
                        
                        
                        Skype will ring for the last time on May 5 as owner Microsoft retires the two-decade-old internet calling service that redefined how people connect across borders.
Shutting down Skype will help Microsoft focus on its homegrown Teams service by simplifying its communication offerings, the software giant said on Friday.
Founded in 2003, Skype's audio and video calls quickly disrupted the landline industry in the early 2000s and made the company a household name boasting hundreds of millions of users at its peak. But the platform has struggled to keep up with easier-to-use and more reliable rivals such as Zoom and Salesforce's Slack in recent years.
The decline was partly because Skype's underlying technology was not suited for the smartphone era.
When the pandemic and work-from-home fueled the need for online business calls, Microsoft batted for Teams by aggressively integrating it with other Office apps to tap corporate users ‚Äî once a major base for Skype.
To ease the transition from the platform, its users will be able to log into Teams for free on any supported device using their existing credentials, with chats and contacts migrating automatically.
With that, Skype will become the latest in a series of high-flying bets that Microsoft has mishandled, such as the Internet Explorer web browser and its Windows Phone. Other big tech firms have also struggled with online communication tools, with Google making several attempts through apps including Hangouts and Duo.
Microsoft declined to share the latest user figures for Skype and said there would be no job cuts due to the move. It added that Teams has about 320 million monthly active users.
When Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion after outbidding Google and Facebook ‚Äî its largest deal at the time ‚Äî the service had around 150 million monthly users; by 2020, that number had fallen to roughly 23 million, despite a brief resurgence during the pandemic.
Microsoft said on Friday ""Skype has been an integral part of shaping modern communications"".
""We are honoured to have been part of the journey.""

 Amazon debuts new Alexa voice assistant with AI overhaul ,"
                        
                        
                        Amazon unveiled on Wednesday the first major overhaul of its Alexa voice assistant since it was introduced more than a decade ago, embedding it with generative artificial intelligence.

The effort carries significant weight at Amazon, which has plowed billions of dollars into Alexa since its launch in 2014 in the hope of putting the service into a range of devices and ultimately driving sales on its main e-commerce website.

""Alexa knows almost every instrument in your life, your schedule, your smart home, your preferences, the devices you're using, the people you're connected to, the entertainment you love and uses many of the apps you use, a lot of the services you need,"" said Panos Panay, Amazon's head of devices and services, at a launch event in New York.

The new service is called Alexa+, Panay said, echoing the nomenclature of the higher tier of many tech and streaming service offerings.

Alexa+ is free for Amazon Prime members and is priced at $19.99 a month for non-Prime users. The service, which was live as of Wednesday, will be available in March to some users, with the rollout expanding to more people over time.

Panay demonstrated how Alexa can store, through prompts, customer preferences - for example, that a household member is vegetarian and prefers Greek and Italian food but eschews peanut butter. It can be used to make dinner reservations and send timed texts or reminders.

The service can connect to Amazon products such as Ring doorbells to show recordings from its cameras.

Alexa director Mara Segal said Alexa can review documents such as a homeowners association contract so that a resident knows what is allowed, like installing solar panels.

Amazon shares rose about 2 percent to $217.02.

COMPETITION FROM APPLE, GOOGLE

The event marked the unveiling of a secret project known internally as ""Banyan"" aimed at making Alexa more conversational. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can learn from data and improve over time.

While Amazon's Alexa was launched three years after Apple's Siri hit the iPhone maker's devices, Alexa helped make the use of voice assistants more mainstream. Still, the lack of solid improvements and overhauls to Alexa over the years meant an erosion in consumer usage of the service, especially in the age of AI.

Apple has already incorporated its suite of AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, into its Siri voice assistant, while Google has revamped its voice assistant using its AI chatbot Gemini.

Alexa is voice-controlled software installed in products such as smart speakers that can provide answers to user questions, play music, set timers and serve as a hub for home automation, by linking internet-connected devices so that, for instance, a light can be turned on with just voice prompts.

The new Alexa AI service will be able to respond to multiple prompts in sequence and even act as an ""agent"" by taking actions for users without their direct involvement. That contrasts with the current iteration which generally handles only a single request at a time.

Executives have debated charging as much as $10 per month for the new service, people have told Reuters, to recoup some of the investment sunk into the money-losing business. Amazon did not immediately address pricing details.

Amazon has said there are some 500 million Alexa-capable devices in consumer hands already, meaning the revamp is at once a huge money-making opportunity for the Seattle retailer - and a big financial risk if it does not live up to expectations.

Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Echo, acknowledged AI startup Anthropic's contribution to building Alexa+, confirming a Reuters story that Anthropic's Claude was a major underpinning of the service.

 China says Taiwan seeks to give away chip industry to US ,"
                        
                        
                        China said on Wednesday that Taiwan was seeking to give away the island's semiconductor industry to the United States as a ""souvenir"" and leverage it to seek political support from Washington.

US media have said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to companies such as Apple and Nvidia, has been in talks for a stake in Intel.

Neither TSMC nor Intel has confirmed the reports and Taiwan's government says it has not received information about any overseas investment application from TSMC.

US President Donald Trump has criticised Taiwan for taking away American semiconductor business, saying he wants the industry to manufacture more in the United States.

Speaking at a regular news conference in Beijing, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said, without offering evidence, that people in Taiwan were concerned TSMC could become ""United States Semiconductor Manufacturing Co"".

""In order to seek selfish gain, the Democratic Progressive Party authorities have freely made demands from external forces, using Taiwan's semiconductor industry and powerful companies to get a foot in the door to relying on foreign countries to seek independence, and even give them away as souvenirs,"" Zhu said, referring to Taiwan's ruling party.

While China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, despite the strong objections of the government in Taipei, Beijing has no say in foreign investment approval decisions by Taipei.

Zhu said Taiwan was trying to ""sell out"" Taiwanese companies.

""This sort of shameless selling out of Taiwan is in actuality pandering to the United States,"" she said.

Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that TSMC was an ""important Taiwanese company"".

""In response to the challenges posed by Trump's new policies towards our semiconductor industry and TSMC, our government will work closely with industry to maintain Taiwan's leading position in the field of advanced technology,"" it said, without elaborating.

TSMC did not respond to a request for comment.

The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, though it does not formally recognise the island's government.

 DeepSeek rushes to launch new AI model as China goes all in ,"
                        
                        
                        DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.

The Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.

Now, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January's R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.

Deepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.

The company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2's release have not been previously reported.

DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Rivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by US tech giants.

""The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,"" said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models ""would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,"" he said.

R2 is likely to worry the US government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.

Little is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as ""low-key and introverted,"" has not spoken to any media since July 2024.

Reuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.

They told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China's high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.

DIFFERENT PATH

Liang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.

One of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a ""flat management style.""

At DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and ""996"" - working from 9am to 9pm six days a week.

Liang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China's two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere.

""Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,"" said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. ""DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.""

Liang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek.

While Baidu and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model's quality.

Both DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang.

The largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China's most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry.

COMPUTING POWER

DeepSeek's success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer's decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said.

The quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going ""all in"" on AI by re-investing 70 percent of its revenue, mostly into AI research.

High-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models.

DeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials' thinking.

""Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?"" the person said. ""How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?""

Authorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek's fortunes: the US banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation.

Beijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking.

Authorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said.

China's cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China's securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.

As one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China's best research talent, two former employees said.

""The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,"" said Liu, the former employee.

Some Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters' requests to provide proof.

DeepSeek has not responded to Wang's claims. Two former employees attributed the company's success to Liang's focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.

The startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.

The MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.

MLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.

While competitors like France's Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.

DeepSeek's pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.

For now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek's success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.

OpenAI cut prices this month, while Google's Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1's launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.

Adnan Masood of US tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI's scaled-down model.

STATE EMBRACE

Even before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing's favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms.

The subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing's belief that it can out-innovate the US, with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms.

At least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies say they have deployed DeepSeek into their systems, while tech giants Lenovo 0992.HK, Baidu 9888.HK and Tencent 0700.HK - owner of China's largest social media app WeChat - have integrated DeepSeek's models into their products.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Li ""have signalled they endorse DeepSeek,"" said Alfred Wu, an expert on Chinese policymaking at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. ""Now everyone just endorses it.""

The Chinese embrace comes as governments from South Korea to Italy remove DeepSeek from national app stores, citing privacy concerns.

""If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,"" said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital.

Further limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged.

""Our problem has never been funding,"" he told Waves in July. ""It's the embargo on high-end chips.""

 Tech experts Trump fired from US watchdog say consumers at risk ,"
                        
                        
                        US consumers are at greater risk of being exploited by tech giants and financial firms after President Donald Trump fired a team of technologists from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), former staff and experts said.

As part of a broader drive to cut federal employees, up to 20 technologists who specifically investigated artificial intelligence (AI), algorithms, and confusing user interfaces were sacked on Feb 13 from the watchdog, which regulates financial products and services to ensure fair practices.

Eric Null, who leads work on privacy legislation at the Centre for Technology and Democracy, a Washington‚Äìbased nonprofit that focuses on digital rights, said malicious individuals would be empowered by the weakening of the CFPB.

""With little-to-no oversight, wrong-doers and fraudsters will only be emboldened to exploit the opportunity to engage in harmful behaviour, like violating people's privacy or engaging in fraud,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

On Feb 10, the White House described the CFPB as a ""woke, weaponised arm of the bureaucracy"".

The Trump administration then dismissed scores of its 1,700 workers before temporarily agreeing not to fire any more staff, according to a court order issued on Feb 14 after a case brought by an employee union and others.

The sudden halt to CFPB's works leaves much of consumer finance, from mortgage companies to payment apps, unsupervised, and removes a venue where consumers could file complaints about their providers.

Erie Meyer, the CFPB's former chief technologist who resigned on Feb 7 before the sackings, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that her team worked on the expansion of chat bots and consumer finance, among other things.

Locked out of their work accounts, it was impossible for team members to say exactly how many CFPB technologists had been fired, but Meyer said it was all, or very nearly all of them.

""What happens when a senior calls their financial institution and asks for help and gets stuck in a doom loop with a robot? I think it's really important (to have) somebody who not only knows what AI is, but can understand what it would mean to somebody who was urgently trying to get help,"" she said.

The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment on the sackings before publication.

PAYMENT SYSTEM SCRUTINY

The CFPB was set up in 2010 to protect consumers after lax mortgage rules and other industry practices led to the financial crisis of 2008. Some financial firms have accused the bureau of overreach and overzealous enforcement actions.

Since it started to hire technologists in 2022, the CFPB has issued several multi-million dollar payment orders against financial technology companies including Wise, formerly TransferWise, Block, which operates mobile payments app Cash App, and Apple and Goldman Sachs over the Apple credit card.

Payment companies are investing more in technology such as AI, while tech firms such as Meta, Apple, Google are expanding into the financial sector. All have come under CFPB scrutiny.

Billionaire Elon Musk, who owns X, formerly Twitter and is leading Trump's cost-cutting programme, has vowed to destroy the CFPB as part of a broad purge of the federal labour force.

Musk and other tech CEOs, including Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, have sought to foster close relationships with Trump and attended his Jan. 20 inauguration.

Their companies have modified internal policies to align with Trump's own agenda and the executive orders he has signed since taking office.

Following the sackings at the consumer watchdog, ongoing investigations and legal battles - including into tech giants - are in limbo.

CFPB opened an investigation into Meta in October over alleged use of financial information from third parties for advertising. Meta refuted the claims at the time and did not respond to a request for comment before publication.

In December, the CFPB said it had supervising authority over Google Pay, and the search giant sued the agency over what Google spokesman Jose Castaneda called ""a clear case of government overreach"".

""It is possible that CFPB-initiated litigation against certain favoured companies may not be pursued as rigorously, or at all, either for ideological or staffing-related reasons,"" Null told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

FUTURE RISKS

Lilian Coral, head of the Open Technology Institute at liberal think tank New America, said the CFPB's work was crucial, especially in the absence of privacy legislation around emerging technologies and the selling of data by data brokers.

""Gutting the CFPB in the short-term eliminates a voice and tool within the government to prevent companies' misuse of consumers' data,"" she said.

""In the long run, we know that the selling, breaching and misuse of data will continue to happen without legislation to ensure accountability. This will cost ordinary Americans billions of dollars,"" Coral said.

One former CFPB employee who was fired as part of the cull said consumers were at greater risk of falling victim to tactics used to trick or deceive them by feigning urgency or disguising advertising, known as 'dark patterns'.

The CFPB technologists were also investigating whether consumers received clear information on how new AI tools made decisions on, for example, approved mortgages or student loan repayments.

The former employee, who declined to be named, said the removal of the technologists would allow companies to escape oversight on how they build products and the tech involved.

""Without people who have a better chance of understanding the underlying technology ... I think the harms that could occur are amplified,"" they said.

""When they appear more noticeable, it could be too late.""

" Apple plans $500 billion in US investment, 20,000 research jobs in next four years ","
                        
                        
                        Apple said on Monday it would spend $500 billion in US investments in the next four years that will include a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers and add about 20,000 research and development jobs across the country in that time.

That $500 billion in expected spending includes everything from purchases from US suppliers to US filming of television shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service. The company declined to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend with its US supply base, which includes firms such as Corning that makes glass for iPhones in Kentucky.

The move comes after media reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook met President Donald Trump last week. Many of Apple's products that are assembled in China could face 10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier this month, though the iPhone maker had secured some waivers from China tariffs in the first Trump administration.

""This pledge represents a political gesture towards the Trump administration,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at DA Davidson, noting that the $500 billion likely includes all of Apple's spending in the US, including general and administrative costs.

""It is unclear whether this announcement represents an acceleration in spend.""

Apple made a similar announcement about its US spending plans in 2018, during the first Trump administration, when it said its new and ongoing investments would contribute $350 billion to the US economy over five years.

Shares were down 0.8 percent in pre-market trading.

Trump, in a Truth Social post, thanked Apple and Cook, saying the move reflected the company's faith in his administration.

Most of Apple's consumer products are assembled outside the US, though many of Apple components are still made there, including chips from Broadcom, SkyWorks Solutions and Qorovo.

Apple said it last month started mass producing chips of its own design at an Arizona factory owned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Bringing TSMC to Arizona and helping introduce legislation that later became the CHIPS Act to bolster US semiconductor production were two of Trump's biggest industrial policy moves during his first term.

Apple said on Monday it will work with Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, to build a 250,000-square-foot facility in Houston, where it will assemble servers that go into data centers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features that help draft emails and perform other tasks. Those servers are currently made outside of the US, Apple said.

Apple said it plans to increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, with part of the expansion being a ""multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce advanced silicon"" at TSMC's Arizona factory.

Apple did not disclose details of its deal with TSMC, but it has in the past used the fund to help partners build out the infrastructure needed to deliver products or services for Apple.

Apple will also open a manufacturing academy in Michigan where its engineers, along with local university staff, will offer free courses for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas such as project management and manufacturing process optimisation.

 Musk's Starlink races with Chinese rivals to dominate satellite internet ,"
                        
                        
                        Space is about to get more crowded for Elon Musk.

The billionaire's Starlink communications network is facing increasingly stiff challenges to its dominance of high-speed satellite internet, including from a Chinese state-backed rival and another service financed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.

Shanghai-based SpaceSail in November signed an agreement to enter Brazil and announced it was in talks with over 30 countries. Two months later, it began work in Kazakhstan, according to the Kazakh embassy in Beijing.

Separately, Bras√≠lia is in talks with Bezos's Project Kuiper internet service and Canada's Telesat TSAT.TO, according to a Brazilian official involved in the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss ongoing talks. News of those discussions is being reported for the first time.

Starlink has since 2020 launched more satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) - an altitude of less than 2,000 km - than all its competitors combined. Satellites operating at such low altitudes transmit data extremely efficiently, providing high-speed internet for remote communities, seafaring vessels and militaries at war.

Musk's primacy in space is seen as a threat by Beijing, which is both investing heavily in rivals and funding military research into tools that track satellite constellations, according to Chinese corporate filings and academic papers whose details have not been previously reported.

China launched a record 263 LEO satellites last year, according to data from astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell analyzed by tech consultancy Analysys Mason.

The emergence of competition to Starlink has been welcomed by Brazil's government, which wants high-speed internet for communities in far-flung areas but has previously faced off with Musk over commerce and politics.



SpaceSail declined to comment when presented with Reuters' questions about its expansion plans. A newspaper controlled by China's telecoms regulator last year praised it as ""capable of transcending national boundaries, penetrating sovereignty and unconditionally covering the whole world ... a strategic capability that our country must master.""

Kuiper, Telesat, Starlink and Brazil's communications ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

Few of Musk's international rivals have the same ambition as SpaceSail, which is controlled by the Shanghai municipal government. It has announced plans to deploy 648 LEO satellites this year and as many as 15,000 by 2030; Starlink currently has about 7,000 satellites, according to McDowell, and has set itself a target of operating 42,000 by the end of the decade.

SpaceSail's launches will eventually comprise the Qianfan, or ""Thousand Sails,"" constellation that marks China's first international push into satellite broadband. Three other Chinese constellations are also in development, with Beijing planning to launch 43,000 LEO satellites in the coming decades and investing in rockets that can carry multiple satellites.

""The endgame is to occupy as many orbital slots as possible,"" said Chaitanya Giri, a space technology expert at India's Observer Research Foundation.

China's rush to occupy more of lower-Earth orbit has raised concerns among Western policymakers, who worry that it could extend the reach of Beijing's internet censorship regime. Researchers at the American Foreign Policy Council think-tank said in a February paper that Washington should increase cooperation with Global South nations if it wanted to ""seriously contest China's growing foray into digital dominance.""

The researchers also described Qianfan as a crucial part of the space component of China's Belt and Road Initiative. The $1 trillion global infrastructure development plan is a signature policy of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but has been accused by critics of being primarily a tool to expand Beijing's geopolitical influence.

China's commerce ministry and telecoms regulator did not respond to requests for comment. China's foreign ministry said in response to Reuters' questions that while it was not aware of the specifics surrounding SpaceSail and Chinese LEO satellites expanding overseas, Beijing pursues space cooperation with other countries for the benefit of their peoples.

SpaceSail has said it aims to supply reliable internet to more users, particularly those in remote areas and during recovery from emergencies and natural disasters.



WILD WEST

Starlink's rapid expansion and its use in the war in Ukraine has caught the attention of military researchers like those at China's National University of Defense Technology, prompting significant state funding for rival satellite networks.

Hongqing Technology, which was founded in 2017 and is developing a 10,000-satellite constellation, this month raised 340 million yuan from mostly state-affiliated investors.

Last year, SpaceSail secured 6.7 billion yuan ($930 million) in a financing round led by a state-owned investment fund focused on upgrading China‚Äôs manufacturing capabilities.

Chinese researchers, including many affiliated with the People's Liberation Army, have also turned their attention to the field. China published a record 2,449 patents related to LEO satellite technology in 2023, up from 162 in 2019, according to Anaqua‚Äôs AcclaimIP database.

Many focus on cost-efficient satellite networks and low-latency communication systems, according to a Reuters review, underscoring China's push to close the technology gap.

""The space world is moving fast and busy experimenting,"" said Antoine Grenier, global head of space at the Analysys Mason consultancy. ""Pioneers are enjoying this relative freedom and are shaping it to their advantage to claim key positions before rules become more stringent ‚Äì like the wild west.""

Some of the Chinese research appears to be targeted at Starlink, with one PLA-linked patent application describing the US system as critical to reconnaissance and military communications while posing ""threats to network, data, and military security.""

Beijing is also developing tools to track and monitor Starlink's constellation. Researchers from two PLA-affiliated institutes said in a January study published in a Chinese engineering journal that they had designed a system and algorithm for tracking megaconstellations like Starlink's, which was inspired by how humpback whales trap their prey by circling them and creating spiralling bubbles.

""With the growing trend of space militarization, developing tools to monitor and track these megaconstellations is critically important,"" the researchers wrote.

 Apple pulls data protection feature in UK amid government demands ,"
                        
                        
                        Apple is scrapping its most advanced security encryption feature for cloud data in Britain, the company said on Friday, an unprecedented response to government demands for access to user data.

The change affects a feature called Advanced Data Protection (ADP), which extends end-to-end encryption across a wide range of cloud data. Apple said it is no longer available in Britain for new users, with those who try to turn it on receiving an error message starting Friday, and that current users will eventually need to disable this security feature.

The move means iCloud backups in Britain will no longer have that level of encryption, allowing Apple to access in certain cases user data that it otherwise could not, such as copies of iMessages, and hand it over to authorities if legally compelled. With end-to-end encryption enabled, even Apple cannot access the data.

""Apple's decision to disable the feature for UK users could well be the only reasonable response at this point, but it leaves those people at the mercy of bad actors and deprives them of a key privacy-preserving technology,"" said Andrew Crocker, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Governments and tech giants have long been locked in a battle over strong encryption to protect consumers' communications, which the authorities view as a mettlesome obstacle to mass surveillance and crime fighting programs. But such a demand from Britain would be particularly sweeping.

Early plans to let Apple users fully encrypt backups of their devices to the company's iCloud service were dropped in or around 2018 after the FBI privately complained, Reuters has previously reported, but the company eventually went forward with the plan in 2022.

""Lawful access to digital evidence and threat information is rapidly eroding,"" the US Federal Bureau of Investigation says on its website, citing ""warrant-proof encryption"".

Apple has long said that it would never build a so-called backdoor into its encrypted services or devices, because once one is created, it could be exploited by hackers in addition to governments, a sentiment echoed by security experts.

""Ultimately, once a door exists, it's only a matter of time before it's found and used maliciously. Removing ADP is not just a symbolic concession but a practical weakening of iCloud security for UK users,"" said Professor Oli Buckley, a professor in cybersecurity at Loughborough University in Britain.

Data that was encrypted before Apple launched its protection service in late 2022, such as passwords and iMessage and FaceTime messaging services, will remain encrypted.

""We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,"" Apple said in a statement.

The change does not affect encryption of data stored directly on its devices, but in the era of large photo collections, huge messaging histories and regular phone upgrades, many users find it impractical to store all their data on their device alone.

Device-only storage also means that if the device is lost or damaged, all of a user's data could disappear, which drives many if not most consumers to opt for some form of cloud backup that now will be easier for British authorities to access.

SECURITY CONCERNS

Law enforcement agencies have frequently targeted Apple services including iMessage through iCloud backups, which were not end-to-end encrypted before Apple offered Advanced Data Protection.

Those backups - which can contain photos and other sensitive information and are widely used - can no longer be end-to-end encrypted for UK users, Apple said.

While Apple cannot disable ADP for existing users as it does not hold encryption keys, it will prompt users to turn off the feature themselves.

A spokesperson for Britain's Home Office declined to comment on whether such an order had been issued. ""We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,"" the spokesperson said.

The Washington Post reported this month that Britain issued Apple a Technical Capability Notice, requiring access under the broad Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows law enforcement to compel firms to assist in evidence collection.

Technical Capability Notices (TCNs) do not grant blanket access to users' personal data, according to the government's website. Even with a TCN in place, separate authorizations are still required to allow access to data.

Australia has a similar law, and could follow Britain's lead, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society.

""The one thing we see with Commonwealth countries is the second one does something, the others tend to do that. And so I would expect Australia to issue a Technical Capability Notice that probably mirrors this, given their own laws.""

Hall also noted that Alphabet's Android operating system also offers encrypted backups.

Apple shares ended largely unchanged on Friday.

The company has long resisted government efforts to weaken encryption, including in 2016 when U.S. authorities tried to compel it to unlock the iPhone of a San Bernardino shooter.

Efforts to subvert it date back to the 1990s, when former US President Bill Clinton's administration first proposed adding a physical chip to computer hardware that would give cops and spies a way of eavesdropping on encrypted communications.

The effort foundered, and strong encryption has since made its way into an increasing number of consumer services, including Apple's iMessage, Zoom meetings, Meta's WhatsApp and the privacy-focused app Signal.

Some US officials have encouraged the use of encrypted services in the wake of December's widespread Salt Typhoon hack on US telecommunications firms.

Meredith Whittaker, president of Signal, which has previously threatened to leave Britain over similar concerns, called Britain's move ""technically illiterate"" and said that it would hurt the country's efforts to cultivate its tech sector.

""You can‚Äôt be tech-friendly while eroding the foundation of cybersecurity on which robust tech depends. Encryption is not a luxury - it is a fundamental human right essential to a free society that also happens to underpin the global economy,"" Whittaker said.

 Banks sell down more X debt; just $1.3 billion now left on their books ,"
                        
                        
                        Banks led by Morgan Stanley have sold to investors another chunky portion of loans that formed the $13 billion debt supporting Elon Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, now X, in 2022, a source with knowledge of the deal said.

On Thursday, they completed the secondary sale of $4.74 billion of secured loans which mature in October 2029. The loans paid a fixed rate yield of 9.5% and priced at par or at 100 cents to the dollar, said the source. The loan sale was upsized from an initial $2.97 billion.

With the latest sale, the banks - that besides Morgan Stanley includes Bank of America, Barclays, Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, Mizuho, and Societe Generale- have been able to shed almost all of the $13 billion they have been holding on their books for nearly two years.

The X acquisition was funded by a $6.5 billion secured term loan, a $500 million revolving credit facility, $3 billion unsecured loan and $3 billion of secured loans.

The timing of the sale of a balance $1.3 billion in unsecured loans still with the banks is unclear, said the source.

In early February, the banks sold $5.5 billion of a term loan which came after a separate $1 billion private sale of the same loans, the source said.

That loan was priced with a floating rate of interest at 97 cents to the dollar and an initial yield of 11%.

The latest tranche to be sold was a fixed-rate loan which is rare and the largest-ever, according to an International Financing Review report.

The first source said the deal found broad interest from large fund managers who were attracted by the prospect of improving revenues of X after Trump's election victory in November and Musk's emergence as a close aide to the new president.

Banks typically sell such loans to investors soon after the deal is done, but in the case of X, they have been stuck holding it for two years.

The first tranche of loans sold were bid higher than their 97 cents to the dollar pricing, according to one trader source, which could have helped the sale of the latest tranche.

One selling point was that investors will gain exposure to X's stake in Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI, the source said.

Barclays, BNP Paribas, Mizuho, Societe Generale declined to comment and other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Google changed the name for US users of Google Maps to reflect the decision by the government of US President Donald Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico.

Sheinbaum has repeatedly decried the move, arguing the ""Gulf of Mexico"" name has long been recognized internationally. On Thursday, the leader said Google had not resolved Mexico's earlier complaints.

                        South Korea's industry ministry has temporarily blocked employee access to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek due to security concerns, a ministry official said on Wednesday, as the government urges caution on generative AI services.

The government issued a notice on Tuesday calling for ministries and agencies to exercise caution about using AI services including DeepSeek and ChatGPT at work, officials said.

State-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power said it had blocked use of AI services including DeepSeek earlier this month.

The defence ministry has also blocked access to DeepSeek on its computers that are for military use, officials said on Thursday.

The foreign ministry has restricted access to DeepSeek in computers that connect to external networks, Yonhap News Agency said. The ministry said it cannot confirm specific security measures.

DeepSeek did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

It was not immediately clear if the ministries had taken any actions against ChatGPT.

The ban makes South Korea the latest government to warn about or place restrictions on DeepSeek.

Australia and Taiwan have banned DeepSeek this week from all government devices over concerns that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup poses security risks.

Italy's data protection authority ordered DeepSeek in January to block its chatbot in the country after the Chinese startup failed to address the regulator's concerns over its privacy policy.

Some other governments in Europe, the US and India are also examining implications of using DeepSeek.

South Korea's information privacy watchdog plans to ask DeepSeek about how the personal information of users is managed.

Chinese startup DeepSeek's launch of its latest AI models last month sent shockwaves through the tech world. The company says its models are on a par with or better than products developed in the United States and are produced at a fraction of the cost.

South Korean chat app operator Kakao Corp has told its employees to refrain from using DeepSeek due to security fears, a spokesperson said on Wednesday, a day after the company announced its partnership with generative artificial intelligence heavyweight OpenAI.

Korean tech companies are now being more careful about using generative AI. SK Hynix, a maker of AI chips, has restricted access to generative AI services, and allowed limited use when necessary, a spokesperson said.

Naver, a major South Korean web portal, said it had asked employees not to use generative AI services that store data outside the company.

 Google scraps diversity-based hiring targets ,"
                        
                        
                        Alphabet's Google is scrapping its goal to hire more employees from underrepresented groups and is reviewing some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, joining a slew of US businesses scaling back diversity initiatives.

""In 2020, we set aspirational hiring goals and focused on growing our offices outside California and New York to improve representation,"" Fiona Cicconi, Alphabet's chief people officer, said in the memo on Wednesday, a copy which was reviewed by Reuters. ""...but in the future we will no longer have aspirational goals.""

Google had been for years among the most vocal companies pushing for more inclusive policies in the wake of protests against the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans in 2020.

In 2020, CEO Sundar Pichai set a goal to have 30% more of its leaders be from underrepresented groups by 2025. At the time, about 96% of Google's US leaders were white or Asian, and 73% globally were men.

In 2021, it began to evaluate executive performance on team diversity and inclusion after a prominent leader of artificial intelligence research said the company abruptly fired her after she criticized its diversity efforts. Google's chief diversity officer Melonie Parker said in a 2024 interview with BBC that the company had hit 60% of its five-year goals.

On Wednesday, the Alphabet spokesperson said the company did not have updated figures regarding Pichai's goals.

Alphabet's annual filing with the US SEC on Wednesday showed it omitted a line saying it was ""committed to making diversity, equity and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.""

That statement appeared in annual reports from 2021 to 2023. The spokesperson said the line was removed to reflect its review of DEI programs.

Google, which sells cloud computing and other services to the US government, also said it was reviewing policy changes by President Donald Trump aimed at curbing DEI in the government and among federal contractors.

""Because we are a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes to our programs required to comply with recent court decisions and US Executive Orders on this topic,"" Cicconi said in the email.

The company will maintain internal employee groups like ""Trans at Google,"" ""Black Googler Network"" and the ""Disability Alliance,"" which the company has said inform decisions around products and policies.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on Wednesday about the memo.

Facebook parent Meta Platforms in January said in an internal memo it was ending its DEI programmes, including those for hiring, training and picking suppliers.

Amazon also said it was ""winding down outdated programs and materials"" related to representation and inclusion, in a memo to its employees, seen by Reuters.

Conservative groups, fortified by a 2023 US Supreme Court ruling that invalidated affirmative action in university admissions, have condemned DEI programs and have threatened litigation against companies implementing them.

 Amazon set to release long-delayed Alexa generative AI revamp ,"
                        
                        
                        Amazon is set to release its long-awaited - and delayed - Alexa generative artificial intelligence voice service, said three people familiar with the matter, and has scheduled a press event for later this month to preview it.

Once released, it would mark the most significant upgrade to the product since its initial introduction accelerated a wave of digital assistants more than a decade ago.

Amazon on Wednesday sent press invites to an event to be held on February 26 in New York featuring the head of its devices and services team, Panos Panay. A spokesperson said the event is Alexa-focused, while declining to elaborate.

The new generative AI-powered Alexa represents at once a huge opportunity for Amazon, which counts more than half a billion Alexa-enabled devices in the market, and a tremendous risk. Amazon is hoping the revamp, designed to be able to converse with users, can convert some of its hundreds of millions of users into paying customers in an effort to generate a return for the unprofitable business.

The AI service will be able to respond to multiple prompts in sequence and, company executives have said, even act as an ‚Äúagent‚Äù on behalf of users by taking actions for them without their direct involvement. That contrasts with the current iteration, which generally handles only a single request at a time.

Executives have scheduled a meeting, known as a ""Go/No-go,"" for February 14. There they will make a final decision on the ""street readiness"" of Alexa's generative AI revamp, according to the people and an internal planning document seen by Reuters.

Alexa's revamp carries with it all the challenges inherent in now-familiar generative AI chatbots from OpenAI, Alphabet and others including the possibility of fabricated answers, known as hallucinations. With access to Alexa available in cars, televisions, thermostats and mobile phones, it could become an essential daily tool for scheduling and even shopping.

Initially, Amazon plans to roll out the new Alexa service to a limited number of users and will not charge for it, the people said, though it has considered a $5 to $10 monthly fee. The company will also continue to offer what it is calling ‚ÄúClassic Alexa,‚Äù the version broadly available today for free. One of the people said Amazon has discontinued adding new offerings to Classic Alexa.

BEZOS' VISION

While Apple's Siri voice assistant preceded Alexa's 2014 release by three years, the Amazon service supercharged the acceptance of voice assistants. But for many people, Alexa is now used for little more than kitchen timers and weather updates due to its lack of significant overhauls in the last few years.

Alexa is the brainchild of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who envisioned a service that would resemble the voice-activated computers on TV's ""Star Trek."" The hope was that once perfected, users would turn to the voice assistant for hundreds of everyday tasks like turning on lights, preheating the oven, accessing the internet, playing music, writing emails and summoning taxis.

‚ÄúSomeday in the future - that might be years or decades away - it could answer everything that you would ever ask it,‚Äù Amazon‚Äôs then-chief of devices, Dave Limp, said nearly a decade ago.

With those weighty expectations, the move to upgrade Alexa has suffered delays over concerns around the quality and speed of its responses, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Amazon dubbed the new service ‚ÄúBanyan‚Äù internally, as well as ‚ÄúRemarkable Alexa,‚Äù though it was not immediately clear if the Seattle company planned on using either as a new product name.

In a January Financial Times interview, Amazon executive Rohit Prasad acknowledged some of the obstacles in developing what is effectively an entirely new service, including the work to eliminate hallucinations.

Analysts at Bank of America estimate Amazon could generate $600 million annually if 10 percent of active users, which it estimates at around 100 million devices, pay $5 per month for the service.

CUSTOMER PREFERENCES

The new Alexa is designed to remember customer preferences to help make music or restaurant recommendations and allow users to give multiple prompts in a single session, so that, say, one could later modify a hamburger order before it is sent out for delivery, the people said.

It will be compatible with existing Alexa devices, said the people.

Amazon will rely, at least in part, on artificial intelligence software from startup Anthropic ‚Äì in which it has invested $8 billion ‚Äì to underpin the AI in Alexa, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

In September 2023, Amazon demonstrated an early version of the souped-up Alexa, but concerns over quality caused Amazon to repeatedly push back its launch date and that rendition was never released to the public.

" Trump, DeepSeek in focus as nations gather at Paris AI Summit ","
                        
                        
                        All eyes are on the French capital next week to see if US President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration can find common ground with China and nearly 100 other nations on the safe development of artificial intelligence.

About a year after world powers reckoned with the dangers of AI in England‚Äôs Bletchley Park, a wider array of countries are gathering in Paris to discuss putting the technology to work.

France, eager to promote its national industry, is hosting the AI Action Summit alongside India on Feb 10 and 11, with a focus on areas where Europe‚Äôs second-largest economy has an advantage: freely available or ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù systems, and clean energy to power data centers.

Mitigating labour disruption and promoting sovereignty in a global AI market are also on the agenda.

Top executives from Alphabet, Microsoft and dozens of other businesses are slated to attend. Government leaders are expected to dine on Monday with select CEOs. And talks will include one on Tuesday by Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, two people involved in the summit told Reuters.

It was less clear whether the US will reach consensus with other nations on AI.

Since taking office on Jan 20, President Trump has revoked former President Joe Biden‚Äôs 2023 executive order on the technology, set in motion a repeat withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and faced Congressional calls to consider new export controls on AI chips to counter rival China.

US Vice President JD Vance will attend for the American delegation.

A non-binding communiqu√© of principles for the stewardship of AI, bearing US, Chinese and other signatures, has been under negotiation and would mark a big achievement if reached, said the people involved in the summit, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

They declined to detail the communiqu√© or elaborate if there were any points of disagreement among the would-be signatories.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

An official for the French presidency said the summit will give voice to countries around the world, not only the US and China.

""We are showing that AI is here, that companies must adopt it, that it is a vector of competitiveness for France and for Europe,"" the √âlys√©e official said.

NO NEW AI REGULATION

Safety commitments dominated the conversation in prior global AI summits in Bletchley Park and Seoul. In Paris, creating new regulation is not on the agenda.

Reeling from red tape and a reputation for risk aversion, Europe and particularly France are eager to discuss frameworks for AI policy but not rules that could slow down their national champions, which have lagged American companies. Countries like France are evaluating how to implement the EU AI Act in as flexible a way as possible so it does not discourage innovation, the people involved in the summit said.

Instead in focus is how to distribute AI‚Äôs benefits to developing nations, via cheaper models made by the likes of France‚Äôs startup Mistral and China‚Äôs DeepSeek. The Hangzhou-based company rocked global markets last month by showing it could vie with US heavyweights on human-like reasoning technology, while charging much less.

France has seized on the development as evidence that the global race to more powerful AI remains wide open.

One of the summit‚Äôs likely outcomes is that philanthropies and businesses are expected to commit an initial $500 million in capital, going up to $2.5 billion over five years, to fund public-interest projects on AI around the world, the people said.

Another is addressing the energy crunch that industry thinks is inevitable from their power-hungry AI models. A major producer of clean energy in the form of nuclear power, France wants to reconcile the world‚Äôs climate and AI ambitions.

France's decarbonised energy and ""nuclear fleet, in the context of data center installations, is an asset,"" the √âlys√©e official said. ""We will most likely have announcements in this regard at the summit.""

" China announces measures against Google, other US firms, as trade tensions escalate ","
                        
                        
                        China announced a wide range of measures on Tuesday targeting US businesses including Google, farm equipment makers and the owner of fashion brand Calvin Klein, minutes after new US tariffs on Chinese goods took effect.

Beijing also slapped tariffs on US products such as coal, oil and some autos in a rapid response to the new duties on Chinese goods imposed by US President Donald Trump, escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.

China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Google was suspected of violating the country's anti-monopoly law and an investigation was initiated in accordance with the law. It did not provide further details on the investigation or on what it alleged Google had done to breach the law.

Google products such as its search engine are blocked in China and its revenue from there is about 1 percent of global sales. It still works with Chinese partners such as advertisers.

In 2017, Google announced the launch of a small artificial intelligence centre in China. But the project was disbanded two years later and the firm does not conduct AI research in China, according to a blog posting.

Separately, China's Commerce Ministry said it had put PVH Corp, the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and US biotechnology firm Illumina on its ""unreliable entity"" list.

It said the two companies took what it called ""discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises"" and ""damaged"" the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.

Companies added to the blacklist can be subject to fines and a broad range of other sanctions, including a freeze on trade and revocation of work permits for foreign staff.

While Google declined to comment, PVH said it was ""surprised and deeply disappointed"" by the ministry's decision, saying that the company maintains ""strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and operates in line with established industry standards and practises.""

PVH added it would continue engagement with relevant authorities and look forward to a positive resolution.

Illumina did not respond to a request for comment.

Shares of both PVH and Illumina were down nearly 4 percent each in premarket US trading, while Google-parent Alphabet rose 1 percent.

PVH had already been under scrutiny from Chinese regulators over ""improper"" conduct related to the Xinjiang region.

""These moves are warnings that China intends to harm US interests if need be, but still give China the option to back down,"" Capital Economics said in a note.

""The tariffs could be postponed or cancelled before they come into effect... The probe against Google could conclude without any penalties.""

TESLA AND FARM EQUIPMENT FIRMS

China also announced 10 percent tariffs on imports of US farm equipment that could impact firms such as Caterpillar, Deere & Co and AGCO, as well as a small number of trucks and big-engine sedans shipped to China from the United States.

That could apply to Elon Musk's Cybertruck, a niche offering Tesla has been promoting in China, as it awaits regulatory clearance to begin sales.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information technology designated the Cybertruck as a ""passenger car"" in a posting in December that was quickly deleted.

If the Cybertruck was designated as an electric truck, Tesla would face a 10 percent tariff on any future imports from its factory in Texas.

Tesla had no immediate comment.

The new tariffs on US products will start on Feb 10, the ministry said.

The announcements made on Tuesday ramped up trade restrictions between Beijing and Washington that had been largely limited to the tech sector under the administration of former US President Joe Biden, which sought to restrict China's access to high-end semiconductors.

China said in December it had launched an investigation into Nvidia over a suspected violation of the country's anti-monopoly law, a probe widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washington's latest curbs on the Chinese chip sector.

Intel's products sold in China were also called for a security review late last year by an influential Chinese industry group.

 Meta's WhatsApp says spyware company Paragon targeted users in two dozen countries ,"
                        
                        
                        An official with Meta Platforms' popular WhatsApp chat service said Israeli spyware company Paragon Solutions had targeted scores of its users, including journalists and members of civil society.

The official said on Friday that WhatsApp had sent Paragon a cease-and-desist letter following the hack. In a statement, WhatsApp said the company ""will continue to protect people's ability to communicate privately.""

Paragon declined to comment.

The WhatsApp official told Reuters it had detected an effort to hack approximately 90 users.

The official declined to say who, specifically, was targeted. But he said those targeted were based in more than two dozen countries, including several people in Europe. He said WhatsApp users were sent malicious electronic documents that required no user interaction to compromise their targets, a so-called zero-click hack that is considered particularly stealthy.

The official said WhatsApp had since disrupted the hacking effort and was referring targets to Canadian internet watchdog group Citizen Lab. The official declined to discuss how it determined that Paragon was responsible for the hack. He said law enforcement and industry partners had been informed, but declined to give details.

The FBI did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton said the discovery of Paragon spyware targeting WhatsApp users ""is a reminder that mercenary spyware continues to proliferate and as it does, so we continue to see familiar patterns of problematic use.""

Spyware merchants such as Paragon sell high-end surveillance software to government clients and typically pitch their services as critical to fighting crime and protecting national security.

But such spy tools have repeatedly been discovered on the phones of journalists, activists, opposition politicians, and at least 50 US officials, raising concerns over the unchecked proliferation of the technology.

Paragon - which was reportedly acquired by Florida-based investment group AE Industrial Partners last month - has tried to position itself publicly as one of the industry's more responsible players.

Its website advertises ""ethically based tools, teams, and insights to disrupt intractable threats,"" and media reports citing people familiar with the company say Paragon only sells to governments in stable democratic countries.

Natalia Krapiva, senior tech-legal counsel at the advocacy group Access Now, said Paragon had the reputation of being a better spyware company, ""but WhatsApp's recent revelations suggest otherwise.""

""This is not just a question of some bad apples ‚Äî these types of abuses (are) a feature of the commercial spyware industry.""

                        The US Commerce Department is looking into whether DeepSeek - the Chinese company whose AI model's performance rocked the tech world - has been using US chips that are not allowed to be shipped to China, a person familiar with the matter said.

 

China's DeepSeek last week launched a free assistant it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of US models. Within days, it became the most downloaded app in Apple's App Store and stirred concerns about United States' lead in AI, sparking a rout that wiped around $1 trillion off US technology stocks.

 

Current restrictions on Nvidia artificial intelligence processors are meant to stop its most sophisticated chips from reaching China.

 

Organized AI chip smuggling to China has been tracked out of countries including Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, the source said.

 

The Commerce Department and DeepSeek did not immediately return requests for comment.

 

An Nvidia spokesperson said many of its customers have business entities in Singapore and use those entities for products destined for the US and the west.

 

""We insist that our partners comply with all applicable laws, and if we receive any information to the contrary, act accordingly,"" Nvidia said.

 

DeepSeek has said it used Nvidia's H800 chips, which it could have legally purchased in 2023. Reuters could not determine whether DeepSeek has used other controlled chips that are not allowed to be shipped to China.

 

DeepSeek also apparently has Nvidia's less powerful H20s, which can still lawfully be shipped to China. The US considered controlling them under the Biden administration and newly appointed Trump officials are discussing that as well.

 

The CEO of AI company Anthropic, Dario Amodei, said earlier this week, ""it appears that a substantial fraction of DeepSeek's AI chip fleet consists of chips that haven't been banned (but should be), chips that were shipped before they were banned; and some that seem very likely to have been smuggled.""

 

The US has put in place a raft of restrictions barring exports of AI chips to China and plans to cap their shipments to a host of other countries.

 Why blocking China's DeepSeek from using US AI may be difficult ,"
                        
                        
                        Top White House advisers this week expressed alarm that China's DeepSeek may have benefited from a method that allegedly piggybacks off the advances of US rivals called ""distillation.""

 

The technique, which involves one AI system learning from another AI system, may be difficult to stop, according to executive and investor sources in Silicon Valley.

 

DeepSeek this month rocked the technology sector with a new AI model that appeared to rival the capabilities of US giants like OpenAI, but at much lower cost. And the China-based company gave away the code for free.

 

Some technologists believe that DeepSeek's model may have learned from US models to make some of its gains. The distillation technique involves having an older, more established and powerful AI model evaluate the quality of the answers coming out of a newer model, effectively transferring the older model's learnings.

That means the newer model can reap the benefits of the massive investments of time and computing power that went into building the initial model without the associated costs.

 

This form of distillation, which is different from how most academic researchers previously used the word, is a common technique used in the AI field. However, it is a violation of the terms of service of some prominent models put out by US tech companies in recent years, including OpenAI.

 

The ChatGPT maker said that it knows of groups in China actively working to replicate US AI models via distillation and is reviewing whether or not DeepSeek may have distilled its models inappropriately, a spokesperson told Reuters.

 

Naveen Rao, vice president of AI at San Francisco-based Databricks, which does not use the technique when terms of service prohibit it, said that learning from rivals is ""par for the course"" in the AI industry. Rao likened this to how automakers will buy and then examine one another's engines.

 

""To be completely fair, this happens in every scenario. Competition is a real thing, and when it's extractable information, you're going to extract it and try to get a win,"" Rao said. ""We all try to be good citizens, but we're all competing at the same time.""

 

Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Commerce who would oversee future export controls on AI technology, told the US Senate during a confirmation hearing on Wednesday that it appeared DeepSeek had misappropriated U.S. AI technology and vowed to impose restrictions.

 

""I do not believe that DeepSeek was done all above board. That's nonsense,"" Lutnick said. ""I'm going to be rigorous in our pursuit of restrictions and enforcing those restrictions to keep us in the lead.""

 

David Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto czar, also raised concerns about DeepSeek distillation in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.

 

DeepSeek did not immediately answer a request for comment on the allegations.

 

OpenAI added it will work with the US government to protect US technology, though it did not detail how.

 

""As the leading builder of AI, we engage in countermeasures to protect our IP, including a careful process for which frontier capabilities to include in released models,"" the company said in a statement.

 

The most recent round of concern in Washington about China's use of US products to advance its tech sector is similar to previous concerns about the semiconductor industry, where the US has imposed restrictions on what chips and manufacturing tools can be shipped to China and is examining restricting work on certain open technologies.

 

NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK

 

Technologists said blocking distillation may be harder than it looks.

 

One of DeepSeek's innovations was showing that a relatively small number of data samples - fewer than one million - from a larger, more capable model could drastically improve the capabilities of a smaller model.

 

When popular products like ChatGPT have hundreds of millions of users, such small amounts of traffic could be hard to detect - and some models, such as Meta Platforms' Llama and French startup Mistral's offerings, can be downloaded freely and used in private data centers, meaning violations of their terms of service may be hard to spot.

 

""It's impossible to stop model distillation when you have open-source models like Mistral and Llama. They are available to everybody. They can also find OpenAI's model somewhere through customers,"" said Umesh Padval, managing director at Thomvest Ventures.

 

The license for Meta's Llama model requires those using it for distillation to disclose that practice, a Meta spokesperson told Reuters.

 

DeepSeek in a paper did disclose using Llama for some distilled versions of the models it released this month, but did not address whether it had ever used Meta's model earlier in the process. The Meta spokesperson declined to say whether the company believed DeepSeek had violated its terms of service.

 

One source familiar with the thinking at a major AI lab said the only way to stop firms like DeepSeek from distilling US models would be stringent know-your-customer requirements similar to how financial companies identify with whom they do business.

 

But nothing like that is set in stone, the source said. The administration of former President Joe Biden had put forth such requirements, which President Donald Trump may not embrace.

 

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 

Jonathan Ross, chief executive of Groq, an AI computing company that hosts AI models in its cloud, has taken the step of blocking all Chinese IP addresses from accessing its cloud to block Chinese firms from allegedly piggybacking off the AI models it hosts.

 

""That's not sufficient, because people can find ways to get around it,"" Ross said. ""We have ideas that would allow us to prevent that, and it's going to be a cat and mouse game ... I don't know what the solution is. If anyone comes up with it, let us know, and we'll implement it.""

" DeepSeek's chatbot achieves 17% accuracy, trails Western rivals in NewsGuard audit ","
                        
                        
                        Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's chatbot achieved only 17% accuracy in delivering news and information in a NewsGuard audit that ranked it tenth out of eleven in a comparison with its Western competitors including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini.

The chatbot repeated false claims 30% of the time and gave vague or not useful answers 53% of the time in response to news-related prompts, resulting in an 83% fail rate, according to a report published by trustworthiness rating service NewsGuard on Wednesday.

That was worse than an average fail rate of 62% for its Western rivals and raises doubts about AI technology that DeepSeek has claimed performs on par or better than Microsoft-backed OpenAI at a fraction of the cost.

Within days of its roll-out, DeepSeek's chatbot became the most downloaded app in Apple's AAPL.O App Store, stirring concerns about United States' lead in AI and sparking a market rout that wiped around $1 trillion off U.S. technology stocks.

The Chinese startup did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NewsGuard said it applied the same 300 prompts to DeepSeek that it had used to evaluate its Western counterparts, which included 30 prompts based on 10 false claims spreading online.

Topics for the claims included last month's killing of UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson and the downing of Azerbaijan Airlines flight 8243.

NewsGuard's audit also showed that in three of the ten prompts, DeepSeek reiterated the Chinese government's position on the topic without being asked anything relating to China.

On prompts related to the Azerbaijan Airlines crash ‚Äî questions unrelated to China ‚Äî DeepSeek responded with Beijing's position on the topic, NewsGuard said.

""The importance of the DeepSeek breakthrough is not in answering Chinese news-related question accurately, it is in the fact that it can answer any question at 1/30th of the cost of comparable AI models,"" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.

Like other AI models, DeepSeek was most vulnerable to repeating false claims when responding to prompts used by people seeking to use AI models to create and spread false claims, NewsGuard added.

                        US officials are looking at the national security implications of the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday, while President Donald Trump's crypto czar said it was possible that intellectual property theft could have been at play.

The National Security Council is reviewing the app's implications, Leavitt said. ""This is a wake-up call to the American AI industry,"" she added, echoing Trump's comments from a day earlier while also saying the White House was working to ""ensure American AI dominance.""

Investors sold technology stocks across the globe on Monday over concerns the emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model would threaten market dominance of US-based AI leaders such as OpenAI and Alphabet's Google.

White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks was asked on Fox News if there was intellectual property theft involved in the rise of DeepSeek.

""Well, it's possible. There's a technique in AI called distillation, which you're going to hear a lot about, and it's when one model learns from another model,"" Sacks said in the interview.

""I think one of the things you're going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation ... That would definitely slow down some of these copycat models,"" he added.

During his administration, former President Joe Biden placed a wide range of export restrictions on AI chips and the equipment used to make them, hoping to hamper AI development in China.

Trump said on Monday the Chinese app should act as a spur for American companies and added it was good that companies in China have come up with a cheaper, faster method of artificial intelligence.

""The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win,"" Trump said.

Sacks told Fox News on Tuesday that American AI companies had ""got a little distracted"" and ""maybe got a little bit complacent.""

Trump said Chinese leaders had told him the US had the world's most brilliant scientists, and he indicated that if Chinese industry could come up with cheaper AI technology, US companies would follow.

""We always have the ideas. We're always first. So I would say that's a positive that could be very much a positive development. So instead of spending billions and billions, you'll spend less, and you'll come up with, hopefully, the same solution,"" Trump said.

Efforts to stop the flow of AI chips to China from US companies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices were spearheaded by the Commerce Department. Trump's choice to lead that agency, Wall Street banker Howard Lutnick, is scheduled to appear in his nomination hearing on Wednesday.

                        A new artificial intelligence, or AI, startup from China has sent shockwaves across the global tech industry, leading to one of the biggest stock market declines in recent history. The company, DeepSeek, has quickly risen to prominence with the launch of its AI assistant, which has become the most downloaded free app on Apple‚Äôs App Store in the United States, surpassing OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT.

The secret behind DeepSeek‚Äôs success lies in its AI model, R1, which offers high performance at a fraction of the cost of traditional AI systems. Unlike models that rely on high-end computing power, DeepSeek claims that R1 achieves similar efficiency while requiring significantly lower hardware resources.

This breakthrough has rattled investors, who are now questioning the future demand for expensive AI chips‚Äîtechnology that major firms like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google have collectively invested billions of dollars into.

TECH GIANTS LOSE BILLIONS

The financial markets reacted immediately to DeepSeek‚Äôs emergence, resulting in a dramatic selloff of tech stocks on Monday.

The biggest loser was Nvidia, the world‚Äôs leading supplier of AI chips, whose stock plummeted nearly 18 percent, marking one of the most significant single-day losses in stock market history.

Other tech giants also suffered major declines:

Microsoft shares dropped 9 percent, as the company has heavily invested in AI through its partnership with OpenAI.
Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, saw its stock fall 6 percent, reflecting concerns over its reliance on expensive AI models.
AMD and Intel, both prominent chip manufacturers, also witnessed significant declines due to fears that the demand for high-end AI chips could weaken.


WHAT‚ÄôS CAUSING THE PANIC?

Investors fear that if DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 model continues to perform efficiently on lower-end hardware, companies may no longer require expensive AI chips. If this trend takes hold, demand for Nvidia‚Äôs advanced GPUs and AI processors could shrink drastically, shaking the very foundation of the AI hardware market.

TEMPORARY OVERREACTION OR PERMANENT SHIFT?

Analysts remain divided on whether DeepSeek‚Äôs rise signals a short-term panic or a long-term industry shift.

Some market experts believe that the stock selloff is an overreaction and that:

US tech companies will not abandon their AI infrastructure for a Chinese startup due to regulatory restrictions, data privacy concerns, and their strong existing partnerships with Microsoft and Nvidia.
	DeepSeek‚Äôs claims still need independent verification, and the model‚Äôs ability to scale remains uncertain.
	High-end computing power is still necessary for training and deploying complex AI models, making it unlikely that DeepSeek‚Äôs approach will completely replace current AI technology.
Other analysts argue that DeepSeek‚Äôs model could fundamentally reshape the AI industry, citing the following reasons:

AI development no longer requires massive computing resources, making high-performance AI accessible at a lower cost.
	If DeepSeek‚Äôs model is scalable, it could challenge Western AI firms, much like how TikTok disrupted the dominance of US social media companies.
	The AI hardware market could contract, forcing chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel to rethink their long-term strategies.
IS AI POWER SHIFTING TO CHINA?

DeepSeek‚Äôs rapid ascent highlights the growing global competition in AI development. Until now, the AI industry has been dominated by Western firms like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. However, DeepSeek‚Äôs rise challenges the idea that AI progress requires billions in investment and vast computing power.

The company‚Äôs emergence also raises key geopolitical and economic questions:

Will DeepSeek expand globally, or will US and European regulators impose restrictions on its growth?
	How will tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia respond‚Äîby shifting to more lightweight AI models or doubling down on high-end AI infrastructure?

" Google pushes global agenda to educate workers, lawmakers on AI ","
                        
                        
                        Alphabet‚Äôs Google, already facing an unprecedented regulatory onslaught, is looking to shape public perception and policies on artificial intelligence ahead of a global wave of AI regulation.

A key priority, one executive told Reuters, comes in building out educational programmes to train the workforce on AI.

‚ÄúGetting more people and organisations, including governments, familiar with AI and using AI tools, makes for better AI policy and opens up new opportunities ‚Äì it's a virtuous cycle,‚Äù said Kent Walker, Alphabet's president of global affairs.

As Google races to best Big Tech rivals including Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Meta in the AI arena, it is mindful of the heavy regulatory scrutiny it faces in its existing businesses in advertising and search.

In the European Union, Google has offered to sell a part of its ad tech business to appease regulators, Reuters reported. In the US, the Justice Department is attempting to force a breakup of its Chrome Web browser ‚Äî though it may shift course under the administration of President Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, governments globally are drafting new regulations on issues that could be exacerbated by AI, such as copyright and privacy. The EU AI Act, which seeks to assess risk and require disclosures from general-purpose AI systems, has received pushback from tech giants that could find themselves in the crosshairs of multibillion-dollar fines.

The DOJ has also sought to curtail Google‚Äôs advances in AI as a remedy in a federal case that found its search business to be an illegal monopoly.

Google executives see an opportunity to shape the narrative around a technology that has stoked emerging fears of mass job loss.

CEO Sundar Pichai announced in September a $120 million investment fund to build AI education programs. Deputies including Walker and Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer, are increasingly travelling globally to discuss policy recommendations with governments.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of upside in terms of helping people who may be displaced by this. We do want to focus on that,‚Äù Walker said.

Efforts include expanding Grow with Google, a combination online and in-personprogram that provides training tools for businesses and teaches workers skills like data analysis or IT support that are meant to expand their career prospects in technical fields.

In December, the company said 1 million people had obtained a certificate for the program. It is adding specialised courses related to AI, such as one geared toward teachers, said programme head Lisa Gevelber.

Courses alone are not enough to prepare workers, Walker said. ‚ÄúWhat really matters is if you have some sort of objective that people are working towards, like a credential that people can use to apply for a job.‚Äù

Google wants to increase experimentation on public-private partnerships, he said. The leading example so far, he said, is the ‚ÄúSkilled Trades and Readiness‚Äù programme, in which the company has partnered with community colleges to train workers for potential jobs constructing data centers. Google is incorporating AI education into the programme, he said.

‚ÄúUltimately, the federal government will look and see which proofs of concept are playing out ‚Äì which of the green shoots are taking root,‚Äù Walker said. ‚ÄúIf we can help fertilise that effort, that‚Äôs our role.‚Äù

In the long term, Walker said he expects a small fraction of existing jobs to be entirely displaced by AI, citing several studies commissioned by Google, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey. Those studies suggest AI will be incorporated into most jobs in some capacity.

As part of Google's efforts to prepare for this shift, it hired economist David Autor as a visiting fellow to study the impacts of AI on the workforce. Autor said in an interview that AI could be used to create more immersive training programmes, akin to flight simulators.

‚ÄúThe history of adult retraining is not particularly glorious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAdults don‚Äôt want to go back to class. Classroom training is not going to be the solution to a lot of retraining.‚Äù

" Trump discussing TikTok purchase with multiple people, decision in 30 days ","
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in the next 30 days.

""I have spoken to many people about TikTok and there is great interest in TikTok,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a flight to Florida.

Earlier in the day, Reuters reported two people with knowledge of the discussions said Trump's administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's operations.

Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, one of the sources told Reuters.

However, in his comments to reporters on the flight, Trump said he had not spoken to Oracle's Larry Ellison about buying the app.

Asked if he was putting together a deal with Oracle and other investors to save TikTok, Trump said: ""No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing.""

The sources did say the terms of any potential deal with Oracle were fluid and likely to change. One source said the full scope of the discussions was not yet set and could include the US operations as well as other regions.

National Public Radio on Saturday reported the deal talks for TikTok's global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the negotiations. Oracle had no immediate comment.

The deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance's current US investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass's Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, or KKR, and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance's US backers.

Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic, KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for comment.

Others vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better known as the YouTube star Mr Beast, are not part of the Oracle negotiation, one of the sources said.

ORACLE RESPONSIBLE

Under the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with Oracle in 2022 to store US users' information to alleviate Washington's worries about Chinese government interference.

TikTok's management would remain in place to operate the short video app, according to one of the sources.

The app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan 19.

Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after US officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.

Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported.

Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake ""in the tens of billions,"" but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying.

Trump has said he ""would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture"" in TikTok.

NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House.

Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the US Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.

The company has said US officials have misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the US.

Samsung also previewed a thinner version of the flagship models at the end of an event in California, aiming to launch the Galaxy S25 Edge in the first half of this year ahead of Apple's anticipated rollout of its slimmer iPhone.

Samsung was faster than Apple in launching an AI-powered smartphone but failed to regain its crown in the global smartphone market last year, squeezed by competition with the US rival in the premium market and with Chinese firms in the lower-end segment.

""We are one step ahead of the industry in terms of offering AI features. I believe we are going in the right direction,"" Park Ji-sun, the executive vice president who leads Samsung's Language AI team, told Reuters.

Samsung kept the prices of its Galaxy S25 series unchanged at between $799 and $1,299.

The new Galaxy S25 uses Gemini offered by Alphabet's Google as its default AI engine, and features Samsung's upgraded in-house voice assistant, Bixby, Park said.

The two tools complement each other, and Bixby plays a key role at Samsung, whose products span mobile phones to TVs and home appliances, he said.

Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester, said that differentiating Bixby would be a challenge for Samsung.

""I don't think there is really a killer application today that you know would convince them (consumers), 'OK, I'm going to buy this one because it's an AI smartphone,'"" he said.

Husson added, however, that AI features could create a halo effect around the Samsung brand.

The Galaxy S25 will offer a more personalized AI experience. For example, its ""Now Brief"" service - which makes recommendations to users based on personalised data that is stored and processed on the phone for privacy reasons - will display a suite of customised items such as calendars, news and bedroom air temperature and carbon dioxide levels, Park said.

The phone will be able to carry out multiple tasks with a single command, such as finding upcoming sporting events and then adding them to users' calendars.

Samsung shares were down 1.1 percent, lagging the wider market's 0.4 percent loss.

Samsung used Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform for the entire Galaxy S25 lineup, ditching its own mobile chip Exynos, a major change of strategy for a company that previously used both to have more bargaining power with suppliers.

Using a Qualcomm chip is a setback to the South Korean firm's chip business, which counts its mobile division as one of its major customers.

Samsung did not say why it decided not to use its own chips in the new model.

A person familiar with the matter said Samsung is looking to use the Exynos chip in its foldable phones to be launched later this year.

""The Galaxy S25 series' sale is important at a time when Samsung's foldable phone sales have been stagnating in the face of challenges from Chinese companies,"" Lim Su-jeong, associate director at research firm Counterpoint, said.

Samsung's preliminary fourth-quarter profit, released earlier this month, missed estimates by a large margin due to chip development costs and rising competition in the smartphone market.

Reliance had urged an auction but the Indian government sided with Musk who wanted it to be allocated administratively, in line with global trends. Analysts say an auction, requiring much more investment, would likely deter foreign rivals.

Ambani said he wanted a level playing field and has been worried that his telecom company, which spent $19 billion in airwave auctions, now risks losing broadband customers to Starlink and potentially even data and voice clients later as technology advances.

""My job as telecoms minister is to make sure that you have as many choices as possible,"" Jyotiraditya Scindia told Reuters during an interview at his ministry's office in New Delhi.

Asked if there was merit in Reliance's concerns, he said, without naming any company: ""Technology is never constant"", adding that companies need to keep evolving.

Scindia noted that current satellite technology for communications requires devices to have the sky in their sight, and smartphones cannot use that technology for indoor services that are provided by terrestrial networks.

""The minute you come into this building, you're done,"" he said.

India is one of the world's biggest telecom markets with 942 million users and stiff competition among Reliance and rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. Data prices are among the cheapest in the world and internet connectivity has risen rapidly.

Deloitte predicts India‚Äôs satellite broadband service market will be worth $1.9 billion by 2030, making it lucrative for players like Starlink, Amazon and Ambani.

Scindia said Starlink and Amazon Kuiper's applications for a licence to launch satellite broadband services in the country were still under review.

VODAFONE IDEA

Musk has a reputation for disrupting markets. In Kenya, he priced Starlink at $10 per month, versus $120 in the United States, prompting a complaint by Kenya's Safaricom last year.

A former aviation minister, Scindia is also overseeing many more telecom initiatives for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

India's government owns a stake in Vodafone Idea, and the company in November disclosed it still had around $24 billion in dues owed to the government.

Scindia repeatedly declined to answer in the interview if there were any plans for relief on the outstanding dues.

The Indian government is, however, working towards reviving state-run telecom player, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), which lost market share amid fierce competition over the years, he said.

BSNL has 99 million users but is being supported with expanded offerings of 4G services.

" TikTok is restoring service, thanks Trump ","
                        
                        
                         TikTok began restoring its services on Sunday after President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the US when he returns to power on Monday.

 

""Frankly, we have no choice. We have to save it,"" Trump said at a rally on Sunday ahead of his inauguration, adding that the US will seek a joint venture to restore the short-video sharing app used by 170 million Americans.

 

In a message to users hours before the rally, TikTok said: ""As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US.""

 

TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services. As of Sunday evening, the app remained unavailable for download on US app stores.

 

""In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,"" TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for ""providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.""

 

TikTok‚Äôs public thanks to Trump, the day before he takes office, comes at a tense moment in US-China relations. Trump has said he intends to place tariffs on China but has also indicated he hopes to have more direct contact with China‚Äôs leader.

 

The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. ""China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,"" a spokesperson said.

 

TikTok stopped working for US users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday. US officials had warned that under Chinese parent company ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.

 

Trump said he would ""extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.""

 

""I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture,"" he wrote on Truth Social.

 

Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order.

 

Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.

 

""A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,"" a message notified users of TikTok, which disappeared from Apple and Google app stores late on Saturday.

 

Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his first term in office. In 2020, he aimed to ban the app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal info with the Chinese government. More recently, Trump has said he has ""a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,"" crediting the app with helping him win over young voters in the 2024 election.

 

In August 2020, Trump signed an executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell TikTok but then blessed a deal structured as a partnership rather than a divestment that would have included both Oracle and Walmart taking stakes in the new company.

 

Not everyone in Trump's Republican Party agreed with efforts to get around the law and ""Save TikTok"".

 

Republican senators Tom Cotton and Pete Ricketts said in a joint statement: ""Now that the law has taken effect, there is no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale that satisfies the law's qualified-divestiture requirements by severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China.""

 

The US has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps.

 

Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday.

 TikTok's fight against going dark gains support from key US lawmakers ,"
                        
                        
                        TikTok's fortunes took a positive turn on Thursday as a growing number of US officials said its Chinese owner should have more time to sell the app and stop it from being banned ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House.

Trump's incoming national security adviser said the new Republican administration will keep the social media app used by 170 million Americans alive in the US if there is a viable deal and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer urged President Joe Biden to extend by 90 days a deadline to shut it down on Sunday.

A law passed in April mandates TikTok's owner, ByteDance, divest TikTok's US assets by Sunday to a non-Chinese buyer, or be banned on national security concerns.

""We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,"" US Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News, pointing to a provision in the law allowing for a 90-day extension if there is ""significant progress"" toward a divestiture.

""Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going,"" said Waltz, who was picked by Trump to be his national security adviser.

A White House official said on Thursday the Biden administration does not plan to enforce the ban on Sunday leaving it up to the Trump administration, though it is not clear if the app will remain online absent a formal extension.

""Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement,"" the official said.

The US Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday absent a divestiture, overturn the law or pause it to give the justices more time to make a decision.

The court said it may issue rulings on Friday, but as is customary, did not state which case or cases would be decided.

Trump once supported a ban on the app but changed his stance last year. His shift came amid growing signs of support for his presidential campaign among tech executives and overtures from Republican donor Jeff Yass, who owns a big share of ByteDance.

In a sign of warming ties between Trump and TikTok, the video app's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will attend the presidential inauguration on Jan 20 and be seated on the dais among other high-profile invitees, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

BIPARTISAN SHIFT

""It's clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,‚Äù Schumer said on the Senate floor, adding that Democrats tried to pass a bill extending the deadline to find a solution to 270 days.

""I will work with the Trump administration and with both parties to keep TikTok alive while protecting our national security,"" he added.

The comments by Schumer, who was a strong supporter of the law to force a sale, are a sign of the growing concern among prominent Democrats about the potential impact and political fallout of shutting down TikTok.

The New York Times reported Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress.

TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokeswoman for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, ""President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there's no better deal maker than Donald Trump.""

'TALKS A BIG GAME'

Still, several Republicans and Democrats remain concerned about Chinese ownership of the app, worried the Chinese government could use it as a tool to collect data on US citizens and to spread propaganda to the public.

""Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok - just like many Republicans voted to do,"" Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote on the social media platform X.

""But now he's inviting TikTok's CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?""

The prospect of a TikTok ban has already triggered some users to seek alternatives, with Chinese social media app RedNote gaining nearly 3 million US users in one day earlier this week, according to analytics firm Similarweb.

Reuters reported that TikTok plans to shut US operations of its social media app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter.

Privately held ByteDance is about 60 percent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 percent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States.

 How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't ,"
                        
                        
                        Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a US investor or the US Supreme Court intervenes.

 

The ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.

 

To pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of US-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.

 

At best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.

 

Here's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.

 

APP 'ROTS'

 

The law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.

 

Even if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to US users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.

 

The TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for US users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.

 

Oracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.

 

Beyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.

 

""Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,"" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. ""And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.""

 

The disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the US, but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.

 

TWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?

 

The most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.

 

But TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

 

Users could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.

 

""It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,"" Kelley said.

 

Some users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.

 

It is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in ""Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.""

 

But even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.

" Apple loses smartphone sales crown in China, drops to third in 2024 ","
                        
                        
                        Apple was dethroned as China's biggest smartphone seller in 2024, with local rivals Vivo and Huawei overtaking the iPhone maker after its annual shipments in the country declined 17 percent, data from research firm Canalys showed on Thursday.

It was Apple's largest-ever annual sales decline in China and involved contraction in all four quarters, including a 25 percent drop in the final quarter, according to the data.

For the full year, budget smartphone maker Vivo captured a 17 percent market share in China, followed by premium rival Huawei with 16% and Apple with 15 percent, demonstrating the growing sales pressure it faces from domestic manufacturers in one of its biggest global markets.

The decline also points to how factors such as the absence of artificial intelligence capabilities in the latest iPhones sold in China, where ChatGPT is not available, are eating into Apple's competitiveness.

""This marks Apple's worst annual performance in China,"" Canalys analyst Toby Zhu said.

""Apple's premium market position faces multiple challenges: Huawei's continuous flagship releases, the proliferation of domestic foldable phones in high-price segments, and Android brands like Xiaomi and Vivo building consumer loyalty through technological innovations,"" he said.

Apple had previously enjoyed four years of consistent growth following US sanctions that placed Huawei on an entity list in 2019, restricting its access to American technology.

But Huawei has made a strong comeback to the premium segment since August 2023, when it launched new phones with locally-made chipsets. The Chinese company posted a 24 percent rise in shipments in the fourth quarter.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The iPhone maker has turned to rare discounts to stimulate sales. The company launched a four-day promotion in China from Jan. 4-7, offering price cuts of up to 500 yuan ($68.50) on its iPhone 16 models through its official channels.

Major Chinese e-commerce platforms have followed suit with their own promotions. Alibaba's Tmall marketplace announced discounts of up to 1,000 yuan ($137) on the latest iPhone 16 series devices.

Among the top five vendors, mostly budget-focused Xiaomi posted the strongest growth with a 29 percent increase in fourth-quarter shipments, while Oppo and Vivo recorded gains of 18 percent and 14 percent respectively, according to the Canalys data.

Annual shipments of smartphones in China in 2024 increased 4 percent year-on-year to 285 million units.

 China gives a wary welcome to influx of 'TikTok refugees' on RedNote ,"
                        
                        
                        Users of the Chinese social media app RedNote welcomed ""TikTok refugees"" from the United States with selfies and messages on Wednesday, as Beijing said it encouraged stronger cultural ties with other countries in response to the sudden influx.

Known in China as Xiaohongshu and as a platform to find lifestyle recommendations on areas from beauty to food, the app has in recent days been transformed into an unexpected bilateral channel for US-China exchanges, with users swapping photos and questions about pets, favourite foods and their lives.

Not everyone was happy, though, with some grumbling that their platform was being taken over and nationalist bloggers warning against American influences.

The influx of more than 700,000 new users has been driven by a looming US ban on TikTok, used by 170 million Americans, on national security concerns.

Many Chinese users on Wednesday posted selfies and messages saying ""welcome TikTok refugees"", and responded eagerly to questions from US users on topics such as popular Chinese dishes, city tourist sights and even China's birth policies.

Among them was Jacob Hui, a translator in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, who said he joined a live chat co-hosted by Chinese and American influencers on the platform and posed questions - such as what video games were popular in the US - to the new users.

""There were not many such opportunities to directly interact with Americans in the past,"" he said.

Chinese state media has also cheered the trend, with state broadcaster CCTV saying that the TikTok users had found a ""new home"". Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun, asked at a regular press briefing, said the use of social media was a ""personal choice"".

""China has always supported and encouraged strengthening cultural exchanges and promoting mutual understanding among the peoples of all countries,"" Guo said.

China has for years tightly controlled cyberspace through its ""Great Firewall"" censorship architecture and blocked foreign social media networks such as Instagram and X.

While many Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo allow foreign phone numbers to register, they usually limit such users to the international versions. ByteDance restricts TikTok to foreign users and runs a separate version for mainland Chinese residents called Douyin.

RedNote, in contrast, does not require users to have such a number and maintains only one version of its app. The company did not respond to Reuters' request for comment on Wednesday.

In the past, other Western social media platforms, such as Clubhouse, have enjoyed a similar trend of Chinese mainland users joining in swathes before being blocked by Beijing's censors.

'PROPAGANDISTS FROM THE UNITED STATES'

The newcomers to RedNote have not been universally welcomed, however, with criticism from some Chinese users unhappy with how they were changing the content of the platform and from some nationalist Chinese bloggers.

Ren Yi, the Harvard-educated grandson of a former Chinese Communist leader who runs a popular WeChat blog under the pen name ""Chairman Rabbit"", warned his followers against being unsuspectingly influenced.

""Propagandists from the United States can easily achieve their goals by following a simple routine - first praise you a few words to make you 'relax your vigilance', and then bring their own goods to subtly influence you,"" he said in an article first published on Wednesday morning that was later deleted.

Beijing-based independent industry analyst Liu Xingliang said he believed the sudden popularity of RedNote among TikTok users would be short-lived, though the current atmosphere was ""very warm and joyful"".

""American netizens are in a dissatisfied mood, and wanting to find another Chinese app to use is a catharsis of short-term emotions and a rebellious gesture. You can see that Xiaohongshu is also caught unprepared, the experience on it is not very good for foreigners,"" he said.

There were also signs that some new foreign users were testing the platform's censorship limits, with some posting on social media network X that they were unable to post about topics known to be sensitive in China such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.

Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing two sources familiar with the company, that the platform was scrambling to find ways to moderate English-language content and build English-Chinese translation tools.

" TikTok prepares for US shutdown from Sunday, sources say ","
                        
                        
                        TikTok plans to shut its app for US users from Sunday, when a federal ban on the social media app could come into effect, unless the Supreme Court moves to block it, sources familiar with the matter said.

The outcome of the shutdown would be different from that mandated by the law. The law would mandate a ban only on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores, while existing users could continue using it for some time.

Under TikTok's plan, people attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public.

The company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, they said.

TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The Information first reported the news.

Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as Blackrock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States.

President Joe Biden had in April last year signed a law requiringByteDance to sell its US assets by Jan 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban.

Last week, the US Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from President-elect Donald Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline.

Trump, whose inauguration takes place the day after the law goes into effect, has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a ""political resolution"" of the issue.

TikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech.

TikTok said in a court filing last month it estimates one-third of the 170 million Americans using its app would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasts a month.

 UK competition watchdog to investigate Google search services ,"
                        
                        
                        Britain will use new regulatory powers to investigate Google's search services to see how they impact consumers and businesses, including advertisers and rivals, following US calls to break up the tech giant.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which gained a wider remit over big tech this month, said search was vital for economic growth and it was critical that competition was working.

""Millions of people and businesses rely on Google's search and advertising services - with 90 percent of searches happening on their platform and more than 200,000 UK businesses advertising there,"" CMA boss Sarah Cardell said.

""It's our job to ensure people get the full benefit of choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal.""

UK regulators including the CMA have been told by the Labour government to prioritise measures that boost economic growth.

Responding to the probe, Google's competition director Oliver Bethell highlighted in a blog post the CMA's comment that search was vital for growth.

Google will engage with the CMA, and lay out how its services benefit consumers and businesses as well as the ""trade-offs inherent in any new regulations"", he said.

""Digital services like Search will power new economic development in the UK,"" Bethell said. ""We welcome the recognition of ... the need to align regulatory decisions with the government's growth mission.""

Urging a pro-innovation, evidence-based regime, Bethell added that ""overly prescriptive digital competition rules would end up stifling choice and opportunity for consumers and businesses"".

US PRESSURE

The CMA's move comes after US prosecutors in November argued to a judge that Google must sell its Chrome browser, share data and search results with rivals, and take a range of other measures to end what they called its monopoly on online search.

In August, a US judge said Google had violated antitrust law, spending billions of dollars to become the world's default search engine.

In the UK, Google is already in the CMA's crosshairs, along with Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud computing market, while the regulator is also set to probe the Google-Apple duopoly in mobile browsers.

Under its new powers, the CMA must designate firms as having Strategic Market Status (SMS) in relation to a digital activity before it can investigate.

It said it would assess whether Google had SMS in both search and in search advertising, and whether it should then impose conduct requirements or intervene in the market.

It will examine barriers to entry and innovation in search and whether Google uses its market dominance to offer preferential treatment for its own services.

Google's collection and use of large quantities of consumer data will also be looked at, it added.

The growth in AI-powered search engines, such as ChatGPT, could challenge Google's dominance in the long term.

The CMA said it would examine whether Google was able to shape the development of new AI services and interfaces to counter this potential threat.

The result of the investigation, which will take up to nine months, could include requiring Google to make data available to other businesses or giving publishers more control over how their data is used, including in Google's AI services.

 Prime Minister Starmer plans to make Britain AI 'superpower' ,"
                        
                        
                        British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence ""superpower"", promising to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers and create zones for data centres.

Starmer, whose Labour government is expected to have little choice but to cut spending after borrowing costs jumped, said he wanted to put AI at the heart of his ambition to grow the economy.

The government says the technology could increase productivity by 1.5% a year, worth an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion), annually over a decade.

""Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers,"" he said on Monday at University College London, noting that the country was already the European leader for AI investment.

""We're going to make the breakthroughs, we're going to create the wealth, and we're going to make AI work for everyone in our country.""

Countries across the world are competing to become AI hubs, while balancing the push for growth with the need for some restrictions on the technology.

The world's sixth-largest economy, Britain is only behind the United States and China, when measured by indicators such as AI investment and patents, according to Stanford University.

Starmer said Britain would chart a ""pro-growth and pro-innovation"" course on regulation.

""I know there are different approaches around the world but we are now in control of our regulatory regime so we will go our own way on this,"" he said, referring to Britain's departure from the European Union in 2020.

""We will test and understand AI before we regulate it to make sure that when we do it, it's proportionate and grounded.""

Britain would put public data, such as information from its state health service, into a ""National Data Library"", where it would be accessible to researchers subject to trusted copyright rules, he said.

The government would also adopt all the 50 recommendations set out in the report ""AI Opportunities Action Plan"" by venture capitalist Matt Clifford, Starmer said.

This includes making it easier to build data centres by accelerating planning permission and giving them energy connections. The first such centre will be built in Culham, Oxfordshire, home to Britain's Atomic Energy Authority.

Britain's economy badly needs fresh momentum after Labour government's highest tax-raising budget since 1993 has dented business confidence and the Bank of England estimated last month that the economy did not grow in the last quarter.

Starmer said AI had the power to transform the lives of people, including speeding up planning consultations, helping small businesses, and reducing bureaucratic burdens for doctors and teachers.

Starmer will say he wants to put AI at the heart of his ambition to grow the economy, while the government will claim if the technology is fully adopted it could increase productivity by 1.5% a year, worth an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion), annually over a decade.

Ahead of a speech in London by Starmer on AI, the government said it will adopt all the 50 recommendations set out in the report ""AI Opportunities Action Plan"" by venture capitalist Matt Clifford, submitted to the government last year.

This includes making it easier to build data centres by accelerating planning permission and giving them energy connections. The first such centre will be built in Culham, Oxfordshire, home to Britain's Atomic Energy Authority.

""Our plan will make Britain the world leader,"" Starmer was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. ""That means more jobs and investment in the UK, more money in people's pockets.""

Countries across the world are competing to turn their countries into AI hubs, while balancing the need for some restrictions on the technology.

Britain is the third-largest AI market in the world behind the US and China, when measured by indicators such as investment and patents, according to Stanford University.

However, the Labour government's decision to set out the highest tax-raising budget since 1993 has damaged some business confidence and the Bank of England estimated last month that the economy did not grow in the last quarter.

Starmer will say on Monday that AI has the power to transform the lives of people, including speeding up planning consultations, helping small businesses, and driving down admin for teachers so they can concentrate on teaching.

""And in a world of fierce competition, we cannot stand by,"" he will say. ""We must move fast and take action.""

 Supreme Court to hear fight over looming US ban on TikTok ,"
                        
                        
                        Facing a looming ban in the United States, TikTok's fate will be in the hands of the Supreme Court in a case being argued on Friday that pits free speech rights against national security concerns over the widely used short-video app owned by Chinese company ByteDance.

TikTok and ByteDance, as well as some users who post content on the app, have challenged a law that would compel the sale of the social media platform by Jan 19 or ban it in the United States. The law was passed by Congress with strong bipartisan support last year and signed by outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden, whose administration is defending it in the case.

A lower court rejected the argument made by the law's challengers that it violates the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgement of free speech.

The Supreme Court's consideration of the case comes at a time of rising trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. Republican Donald Trump, due to begin his second term as president on Jan 20, opposes the ban.

The Supreme Court is poised to weigh competing concerns - about free speech rights and about the national security implications of a social media platform with foreign owners that collects data from a domestic user base of 170 million Americans, about half the US population.

The Justice Department has said TikTok poses a grave threat to US national security because of the risk that China could use this immense trove of data on Americans for espionage or blackmail, or secretly manipulate content that they view on the app to serve its interests.

The platform's powerful algorithm feeds individual users short videos tailored to their liking. TikTok has said that the ban would hit its user base, advertisers, content creators and employee talent. TikTok has 7,000 US employees.

Passage of the law imperils not only the First Amendment rights of both TikTok and its users but ""the entire nation,"" according to the challengers in the case. The platform represents ""one of the most significant speech platforms in America,"" TikTok and ByteDance said in a filing, adding that the law is ""at war with the First Amendment.""

The challengers are supported by several free speech and libertarian advocacy groups. While Trump has vowed to ""save"" the platform, many of his Republican allies support the ban.

The Justice Department has said the law targets control of the app by a foreign adversary, not protected speech, and that TikTok could continue operating as-is if it is freed from China's control.

No one disputes that China ""seeks to undermine US interests by amassing sensitive data about Americans and engaging in covert and malign influence operations,"" the department told the court in a filing, calling the app ""a powerful tool for espionage.""

TikTok, ByteDance and the app users, seeking an injunction to halt the ban, are appealing the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's Dec 6 ruling upholding the law.

Trump on Dec 27 called on the Supreme Court to put a hold on the Jan. 19 deadline for divestment to give the incoming administration ""the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case."" The Justice Department urged the court to reject that request.

The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority including three justices appointed by Trump during his first term as president.

                        Google failed to persuade a federal judge to dismiss a privacy class action claiming it collected personal data from people's cellphones after they switched off a button to stop the tracking, paving the way for a possible August trial.

Chief Judge Richard Seeborg of the federal court in San Francisco rejected arguments that the search engine company adequately disclosed how its Web & App Activity settings worked, and that users consented to the tracking.

Google had also argued that its basic record-keeping ""doesn't hurt anyone.""

Users of Android and non-Android mobile devices accused Google of invading their privacy and violating a California law against unauthorised fraudulent computer access by intercepting and saving their personal browsing histories without consent.

In a 20-page decision on Tuesday, Seeborg said reasonable users could view Google's conduct as ""highly offensive,"" because the company collected data despite fielding concerns from several employees and knowing its disclosures were ambiguous.



He cited internal communications suggesting that Google, a unit of Alphabet, was intentionally vague in distinguishing between data collected inside and outside Google accounts because users might find the truth ""alarming.""

On the other hand, Seeborg said the Google employees might simply have been suggesting ways to improve the Mountain View, California-based company's products and services.

""Whether Google or plaintiffs' interpretation prevails is a triable issue of fact,"" he wrote.

Google said in a statement on Wednesday: ""Privacy controls have long been built into our service and the allegations here are a deliberate attempt to mischaracterise the way our products work. We will continue to make our case in court against these patently false claims.""

Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A jury trial is scheduled for Aug 18. The lawsuit began in July 2020.

Last August, the federal appeals court in San Francisco revived a lawsuit accusing Google of tracking Chrome browser users after they chose not to synchronise their browsers with their Google accounts.

Four months earlier, Google agreed to destroy billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it tracked people who thought they were browsing privately, including on Chrome browsers set to ""Incognito"" mode.

Law firms representing the plaintiffs in that case valued that settlement at more than $5 billion. The same firms represent the plaintiffs in the current case.

                        The suspected driver of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day used popular chatbot ChatGPT to plan the blast, officials told reporters on Tuesday.

The suspect used ChatGPT to try and work out how much explosive was needed to trigger the blast, officials said.

Authorities last week identified the person found dead inside the Cybertruck as Matthew Livelsberger, 37, an active-duty Army soldier from Colorado Springs, and said he acted alone. The FBI says the incident appeared to be a case of suicide.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said on Tuesday the Cybertruck blast was the first incident on US soil where ChatGPT had been used to build an explosive device.

Critics of artificial intelligence have warned it could be harnessed for harmful purposes, and the Las Vegas attack could add to that criticism.

KEY QUOTES

""Of particular note, we also have clear evidence in this case now that the suspect used ChatGPT artificial intelligence to help plan his attack,"" Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told a press conference.

""This is the first incident that I am aware of on US soil where ChatGPT is utilised to help an individual build a particular device,"" McMahill added.

CHATGPT WARNINGS

ChatGPT maker OpenAI said the company was ""committed to seeing AI tools used responsibly"" and that its ""models are designed to refuse harmful instructions.""

""In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities,"" the company said in a statement cited by Axios.

CONTEXT

The FBI says there was no definitive link between a truck attack in New Orleans that killed more than a dozen people and the Cybertruck explosion, which left seven with minor injuries. They added the suspect had no animosity towards US President-elect Donald Trump and probably had post-traumatic stress disorder.

                        Social media company Meta Platforms on Tuesday scrapped its US fact-checking programme and reduced curbs on discussions around contentious topics such as immigration and gender identity, bowing to criticism from conservatives as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time.

The move is Meta's biggest overhaul of its approach to managing political content on its services in recent memory and comes as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been signalling a desire to mend fences with the incoming administration.

The changes will affect Facebook, Instagram and Threads, three of the world's biggest social media platforms with more than 3 billion users globally.

Last week, Meta elevated Republican policy executive Joel Kaplan as global affairs head and on Monday announced it had elected Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close friend of Trump, to its board.

""We've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. It's time to get back to our roots around free expression,"" Zuckerberg said in a video.

He acknowledged the role of the recent US elections in his thinking, saying they ""feel like a cultural tipping point, towards once again prioritising speech.""

When asked about the changes at a press conference, Trump welcomed them. ""They have come a long way - Meta. The man (Zuckerberg) was very impressive,"" he said.

Asked if he thought Zuckerberg was responding to his threats, which have included a pledge to imprison the CEO, Trump said ""probably.""

In place of a formal fact-checking programme to address dubious claims posted on Meta's platforms, Zuckerberg instead plans to implement a system of ""community notes"" similar to that used on Elon Musk-owned social media platform X.

Meta also will stop proactively scanning for hate speech and other types of rule-breaking, reviewing such posts only in response to user reports, Zuckerberg said. It will focus its automated systems on removing ""high-severity violations"" like terrorism, child exploitation, scams and drugs.

The company will move teams overseeing the writing and review of content policies out of California to Texas and other US locations, he added.

Meta has been working on the shift away from fact-checking for more than a year, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.

It has not shared relocation plans with employees, however, prompting confused posts on the app Blind, which provides a space for employees to share information anonymously.

Most of Meta's US content moderation is already performed outside California, another source told Reuters.

Kaplan, who appeared on the ""Fox & Friends"" program on Tuesday morning to address the changes, offered Meta employees only a summary of his public statements in a post on the company's internal forum Workplace, which was seen by Reuters.

A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on planning for the changes or say which specific teams would be leaving California. The spokesperson also declined to cite examples of mistakes or bias on the part of fact-checkers.

The demise of the fact-checking program, started in 2016, caught partner organizations by surprise.

""We've learned the news as everyone has today. It's a hard hit for the fact-checking community and journalism. We're assessing the situation,"" AFP said in a statement provided to Reuters.

The head of the International Fact-Checking Network, Angie Drobnic Holan, challenged Zuckerberg's characterization of its members as biased or censorious.

""Fact-checking journalism has never censored or removed posts; it's added information and context to controversial claims, and it's debunked hoax content and conspiracies,"" she said in a statement.

Kristin Roberts, Gannett Media's chief content officer, said ""truth and facts serve everyone ‚Äî not the right or the left ‚Äî and that's what we will continue to deliver.""

Other partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Reuters declined to comment. Meta's independent Oversight Board welcomed the move.

Zuckerberg in recent months has expressed regret over certain content moderation actions on topics including COVID-19. Meta also donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, in a departure from its past practice.

""This is a major step back for content moderation at a time when disinformation and harmful content are evolving faster than ever,"" said Ross Burley, co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience.

""This move seems more about political appeasement than smart policy.""

For now, Meta is planning the changes only for the US market, with no immediate plans to end its fact-checking program in places like the European Union which take a more active approach to regulation of tech companies, a spokesperson said.

Musk's X is already under European Commission investigation over issues including the ""Community Notes"" system.

The Commission began its probe in December 2023, several months after X launched the feature. A Commission spokesperson said it had taken note of Meta's announcement and was continuing to monitor the company's compliance in the EU.

The EU's Digital Services Act, which came into force in 2023, requires very large online platforms like X and Facebook to tackle illegal content and risks to public security.

Any firm found in breach faces a fine worth up to 6% of its global revenue.

Meta said it would start phasing in Community Notes in the US over the next couple of months and improve the model over the year.

                        Creating and sharing sexually explicit ""deepfakes"" will become a criminal offence in Britain, the government said on Tuesday, in a bid to tackle a surge in the proliferation of such images, mainly targeting women and girls.

Deepfakes are videos, pictures or audio clips made with artificial intelligence to look real, and such technology can be used to digitally alter pornographic images into the likeness of someone else.

Publishing intimate photos or videos without consent and with the intent to cause distress - so-called revenge porn - was criminalised in Britain in 2015, but that legislation does not cover the use of fake images.

Data from UK-based Revenge Porn Helpline showed image-based abuse using deepfakes has increased more than 400% since 2017.

Under the new offence to be introduced by the government, perpetrators could be charged and face prosecution for both creating and sharing these images.

""There is no excuse for creating a sexually explicit deepfake of someone without their consent,"" the justice ministry said in a statement.

The previous Conservative government, which lost power to the Labour Party in July, announced similar plans to make sexually explicit deepfakes a criminal offence. Under its proposal, offenders would face fines and even jail time.

The justice ministry said further details of the new offence would be set out in due course.

The government said it would also create new offences for the taking of intimate images without consent and the installation of equipment with intent to commit these offences. Those found guilty could face up to two years behind bars.

""This demeaning and disgusting form of chauvinism must not become normalised,"" said Victims Minister Alex Davies-Jones.

Technology minister Margaret Jones said tech platforms hosting abusive images would face tougher scrutiny and significant penalties.

""Intimate-image abuse is a national emergency that is causing significant, long-lasting harm to women and girls who face a total loss of control over their digital footprint, at the hands of online misogyny,"" said campaigner Jess Davies.

The new offences will be included in the government's Crime and Policing Bill, which will be introduced to parliament. A date is yet to be set.

                        Funding in India‚Äôs space sector, a key part of the country‚Äôs ambitions to become a global superpower, plummeted by 55% in 2024 to $59.1 million from $130.2 million the previous year, according to data from market intelligence platform Tracxn.

The drop, which came amid a global 20% decline in space sector investment, marks the first fall in at least five years. Globally, space companies raised about $28 billion over the last five years, while their Indian counterparts secured approximately $354 million in the same period, Tracxn data showed.

India‚Äôs space industry has gained global attention with the Chandrayaan-3 lunar landing and the Aditya-L1 solar probe launch. Its private space sector growth is increasingly seen as crucial for achieving the long-term goal a $44 billion private space economy.

The government has sought to stimulate the sector by approving a 10 billion rupee ($119 million) fund in October 2024 to support space startups and setting plans to expand India‚Äôs share of the global commercial space market by 2033.

Industry participants said they expected to see a pickup in funding in 2025.

" Las Vegas Cybertruck suspect used ChatGPT to plan blast, police say ","
                        
                        
                        The suspected driver of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day used popular chatbot ChatGPT to plan the blast, officials told reporters on Tuesday.

The suspect used ChatGPT to try and work out how much explosive was needed to trigger the blast, officials said.

Authorities last week identified the person found dead inside the Cybertruck as Matthew Livelsberger, 37, an active-duty Army soldier from Colorado Springs, and said he acted alone. The FBI says the incident appeared to be a case of suicide.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said on Tuesday the Cybertruck blast was the first incident on US soil where ChatGPT had been used to build an explosive device.

Critics of artificial intelligence have warned it could be harnessed for harmful purposes, and the Las Vegas attack could add to that criticism.

KEY QUOTES

""Of particular note, we also have clear evidence in this case now that the suspect used ChatGPT artificial intelligence to help plan his attack,"" Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told a press conference.

""This is the first incident that I am aware of on US soil where ChatGPT is utilised to help an individual build a particular device,"" McMahill added.

CHATGPT WARNINGS

ChatGPT maker OpenAI said the company was ""committed to seeing AI tools used responsibly"" and that its ""models are designed to refuse harmful instructions.""

""In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities,"" the company said in a statement cited by Axios.

CONTEXT

The FBI says there was no definitive link between a truck attack in New Orleans that killed more than a dozen people and the Cybertruck explosion, which left seven with minor injuries. They added the suspect had no animosity towards US President-elect Donald Trump and probably had post-traumatic stress disorder.

Livelsberger's phone had a six-page manifesto that authorities were investigating, police said.

 Meta shelves fact-checking in policy reversal ahead of Trump administration ,"
                        
                        
                        Social media company Meta Platforms on Tuesday scrapped its US fact-checking programme and reduced curbs on discussions around contentious topics such as immigration and gender identity, bowing to criticism from conservatives as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time.

The move is Meta's biggest overhaul of its approach to managing political content on its services in recent memory and comes as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been signalling a desire to mend fences with the incoming administration.

The changes will affect Facebook, Instagram and Threads, three of the world's biggest social media platforms with more than 3 billion users globally.

Last week, Meta elevated Republican policy executive Joel Kaplan as global affairs head and on Monday announced it had elected Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close friend of Trump, to its board.

""We've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. It's time to get back to our roots around free expression,"" Zuckerberg said in a video.

 Apple offers iPhone discounts in China as competition intensifies ,"
                        
                        
                        Apple is offering rare discounts of up to 500 yuan ($68.50) on its latest iPhone models in China, as the US tech giant moves to defend its market share against rising competition from domestic rivals like Huawei.

The four-day promotion, running from Jan 4-7, applies to several iPhone models when purchased using specific payment methods, according to its website.

The flagship iPhone 16 Pro with a starting price of 7,999 yuan and the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a starting price of 9,999 yuan will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will receive a 400 yuan reduction.

The discounts come as consumers remain cautious with spending amid China's slowing economy and deflationary pressures, with the country's consumer inflation hitting a five-month low in November.

Apple is grappling with declining market share in China, the world's largest smartphone market, where local manufacturers have intensified competition.

Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023 with locally-made chipsets. Huawei had cut the prices of a variety of high-end devices, including mobile phones, by up to 3,000 yuan over the weekend on one of China's leading e-commerce platforms.

Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2024 before recovering in the third quarter. The US company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3% during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42%, according to research firm IDC.

The Apple promotion also includes discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models, as well as other categories of products such as MacBook laptops and iPad tablets. Customers must use designated payment methods including WeChat Pay or Alipay to qualify for the discounts.

 OpenAI outlines new for-profit structure in bid to stay ahead in costly AI race ,"
                        
                        
                        OpenAI on Friday outlined plans to revamp its structure, saying it would create a public benefit corporation to make it easier to ""raise more capital than we'd imagined,"" and remove the restrictions imposed on the startup by its current nonprofit parent.

The acknowledgement and detailed rationale behind its high-profile restructuring confirmed a Reuters report in September, which sparked debate among corporate watchdogs and tech moguls including Elon Musk. At issue were the implications such a move might have on whether OpenAI would allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and how the company would strike a balance between making a profit and generating social and public good as it develops AI.

Under the proposed plan, the ChatGPT maker's existing for-profit arm would become a Delaware-based public benefit corporation (PBC) - a structure designed to consider the interests of society in addition to shareholder value.

OpenAI has been looking to make changes to attract further investment, as the expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses human intelligence, heats up.

Its latest $6.6 billion funding round at a valuation of $157 billion was contingent on whether the ChatGPT-maker could upend its corporate structure and remove a profit cap for investors within two years, Reuters reported in October.

The nonprofit, meanwhile, will have a ""significant interest"" in the PBC in the form of shares as determined by independent financial advisers, OpenAI said in a blog post, adding that it would be one of the ""best resourced nonprofits in history.""

OpenAI started in 2015 as a research-focused nonprofit but created a for-profit unit four years later to secure funding for the high costs of AI development. Its unusual structure gave control of the for-profit unit to the nonprofit and was in focus last year when Sam Altman was fired as CEO only to return days later after employees rebelled.

'CRITICAL STEP'

""We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness,"" the Microsoft-backed startup said on Friday.

""The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission.""

Its plans to create a PBC would align the startup with rivals such as Anthropic and the Musk-owned xAI, which use a similar structure and recently raised billions in funding.

Anthropic garnered another $4 billion investment from existing investor Amazon.com last month, while xAI raised around $6 billion in equity financing earlier in December.

""The key to the announcement is that the for-profit side of OpenAI 'will run and control OpenAI's operations and business,'"" DA Davidson & Co analyst Gil Luria said.

""This is the critical step the company needs to make in order to continue fund raising,"" Luria said, although he added that the move did ""not necessitate OpenAI going public.""

The startup could, however, face some hurdles in the plan.

Musk, an OpenAI co-founder who later left and is now one of the startup's most vocal critics, is trying to stop the plan and in August sued OpenAI and Altman. Musk alleges that OpenAI violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI.

OpenAI earlier this month asked a federal judge to reject Musk's request and published a trove of messages with Musk to argue that he initially backed for-profit status for OpenAI before walking away from the company after failing to gain a majority equity stake and full control.

Meta Platforms is also urging California's attorney general to block OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.

Becoming a benefit corporation does not guarantee in and of itself that a company will put its stated mission above profit, as that status legally requires only that the company's board ""balance"" its mission and profit-making concerns, said Ann Lipton, a corporate law professor at Tulane Law School.

""The only reason to choose benefit form over any other corporate form is the declaration to the public,"" she said. ""It doesn't actually have any real enforcement power behind it,"" she said.

In practice, it is the shareholders who own a controlling stake in the company who dictate how closely a public benefit company sticks to its mission, Lipton said.

                        Iranian authorities have lifted a ban on Meta's instant messaging platform WhatsApp and Google Play as a first step to scale back internet restrictions, Iranian state media reported on Tuesday.

The Islamic Republic has some of the strictest controls on Internet access in the world, but its blocks on US-based social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are routinely bypassed by tech-savvy Iranians using virtual private networks.

 Apple approaches $4 trillion valuation as investors bet on AI momentum ,"
                        
                        
                        Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales.

The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalisation.

The latest rally in Apple shares reflects ""investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades,"" said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a ""hold"" rating.

Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first US company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones.

In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology.

Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period.

Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite.

The company expects overall revenue to increase ""low- to mid-single digits"" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series.

However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025.

""Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's ""top pick"" heading into 2025.

The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations.

""I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today,"" said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares.

Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if US President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10% on goods coming from China.

""We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018,"" Woodring said.

Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year.

""Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.

The Fed's action ""could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology.""

""Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.

Russia denies that, saying the issues are caused by Google's failure to upgrade equipment - a charge disputed by the company and technology experts.

Russian internet monitoring services have reported mass outages of the online video hosting service in the last few months, but communications regulator Roskomnadzor denies blocking YouTube traffic.

" Samsung accuses India antitrust body of detaining employees, seizing data unlawfully ","
                        
                        
                        Samsung has accused India's competition watchdog of unlawfully detaining its employees and seizing data in a raid carried out in connection with an antitrust investigation on Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart, a legal filing shows.

Samsung is embroiled in the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) investigation that in August concluded that the South Korean giant and other smartphone companies broke anti-trust laws by colluding with Amazon AMZN.O and Flipkart to exclusively launch products online.

Samsung's Oct 11 filing in the High Court in northern city of Chandigarh seeks to quash the investigation findings related to conduct of the company, arguing the CCI had illegally seized material from its employees during a 2022 raid at one of Amazon's vendors.

Three Samsung employees were present in the vicinity of the search when the watchdog's officials detained them, seized their phones and copied all the confidential and privileged data, the company said in its 32-page filing, which hasn't been made public.

""The entire search exercise undertaken ... is patently illegal and any material collected thereunder should not be relied upon and should be promptly returned,"" the Indian unit of South Korea's Samsung Electronics 005930.KSwrote.

The CCI ""should be prohibited from using or relying upon the data and information unlawfully collected,"" it added.

Samsung and the CCI did not respond to Reuters queries.

Samsung has obtained an injunction from the High Court that has put on hold the CCI proceedings, but the court has not yet ruled on its requests to return the data seized and to not allow the commission to rely on it.

The CCI has challenged Samsung and 22 other parties that have won similar injunctions from high courts across India, and last week asked the Supreme Court to hear all challenges together, saying the companies were trying to scuttle the investigation.

The CCI investigation had found that Amazon and Flipkart both breached competition laws by favouring select sellers on their platforms. Amazon and Flipkart have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, even as brick-and-mortar retailers continue to complain about their deep discounting and other practices.

In its court filing Samsung also asserted that it was wrongly found to have breached competition laws in collusion with Amazon and Flipkart, even though it had been cooperating with the watchdog and providing information only as a third-party in the case.

The inclusion of smartphone makers in the Amazon and Flipkart investigation could increase legal and compliance headaches for the likes of Samsung.

In the August investigation reports, the CCI noted that Samsung was involved in the practice of exclusive phone launches on Amazon and Flipkart, saying ""exclusivity in business is anathema"" and against free and fair competition.

According to Counterpoint Research Samsung is one of India's biggest smartphone player with a 14% market share. Datum Intelligence estimates that 50% of phone sales were online last year, up from 14.5% in 2013.

 Google says it has cracked a quantum computing challenge with new chip ,"
                        
                        
                        Google  on Monday said that it has overcome a key challenge in quantum computing with a new generation of chip, solving a computing problem in five minutes that would take a classical computer more time than the history of the universe.

Like other tech giants such as Microsoft and International Business Machines, Alphabet's Google is chasing quantum computing because it promises computing speeds far faster than today's fastest systems. While the math problem solved by the company's Santa Barbara, California quantum lab does not have commercial applications, Google hopes quantum computers will one day solve problems in medicine, battery chemistry and artificial intelligence that are out of reach for today's computers.

The results released Monday came from a new chip called Willow that has 105 ""qubits,"" which are the building blocks of quantum computers. Qubits are fast but error-prone, because they can be jostled by something as small as a subatomic particle from events in outer space.

As more qubits are packed onto a chip, those errors can add up to make the chip no better than a conventional computer chip. So since the 1990s, scientists have been working on quantum error-correction.

In a paper published in the journal Nature on Monday, Google said that it has found a way to string together the Willow chip's qubits so that error rates go down as the number of qubits goes up. The company also says it can correct errors in real time, a key step toward making its quantum machines practical.

""We are past the break even point,"" Hartmut Neven, who leads the Google Quantum AI unit, said in an interview.

In 2019, IBM challenged Google's claim that Google's quantum chip solved a problem that would take a classical computer 10,000 years, saying the problem could be solved in two-and-a-half days using different technical assumptions about a classical system.

In a blog post Monday, Google said it took some of those concerns into account in its newest estimates. Even under the most idealistic conditions, Google said a classical computer would still take a billion years to get the same results as its newest chip.

Some of Google's rivals are producing chips with a larger number of qubits than Google, but Google is focused on making the most reliable qubits it can, Anthony Megrant, chief architect for Google Quantum AI, said in an interview.

Google fabricated its previous chips in a shared facility at the University of California, Santa Barbara, but built its own dedicated fabrication facility to produce its Willow chips. Megrant said that new facility will speed up how fast Google can make future chips, which are chilled in huge refrigerators called cryostats to run experiments.

""If we have a good idea, we want somebody on the team to be able to ... get that into the clean room and into one of these cryostats as fast as possible, so we can get lots of cycles of learning,"" Megrant said.

 India questions Musk's Starlink for more clues in $4.2 bn drug smuggling case ,"
                        
                        
                        Indian police have sent a legal demand to Elon Musk's Starlink seeking details of who purchased its internet device that helps in sea navigation when smugglers with $4.2 billion worth of meth were caught in the biggest such Indian seizure.

Two people with direct knowledge of the police notice sent by Andaman and Nicobar island officials said Starlink had been asked for the purchaser's name and payment method, registration details and where the internet device was used when smugglers travelled in international waters from Myanmar to India.

Starlink and Andaman police did not respond to Reuters request for comment.

The incident has set off alarm bells as it is the first time Starlink's device has been used to navigate and reach Indian waters in a major drug haul.

The investigation comes just as the Musk-owned company is trying to address any potential security concerns before it is given a green light to launch its satellite broadband services in India.

Starlink recently won a lobbying battle after a bitter faceoff with billionaire Mukesh Ambani over how exactly New Delhi should allocate satellite spectrum to companies.

Police in the remote outpost of the Andaman and Nicobar islands seized more than 6,000 kg (13,000 pounds) of meth in late November in a Myanmar boat carrying sacks of suspected contraband, and found that the Starlink Mini internet device had been used. Starlink says the device works in international waters.

The police estimated that the seized meth had a retail market value of 360 billion rupees ($4.25 billion).

The first source said Andaman police had sent a notice on Dec 4 under an Indian law that empowers authorities to seek information from companies related to an investigation.

It has also sought the mobile number and email ID registered to the Starlink account, said both the sources, who declined to be named as the matter is sensitive.

" US clears export of advanced AI chips to UAE under Microsoft deal, Axios says ","
                        
                        
                        The US government has approved the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to a Microsoft-operated facility in the United Arab Emirates as part of the company's highly-scrutinised partnership with Emirati AI firm G42, Axios reported on Saturday, citing two people familiar with the deal.

Microsoft invested $1.5 billion in G42 earlier this year, giving the US company a minority stake and a board seat. As part of the deal, G42 would use Microsoft's cloud services to run its AI applications.

The deal, however, was scrutinised after US lawmakers raised concerns G42 could transfer powerful US AI technology to China. They asked for a US assessment of G42's ties to the Chinese Communist Party, military and government before the Microsoft deal advances.

The US Commerce Department, Microsoft and G42 did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The approved export license requires Microsoft to prevent access to its facility in the UAE by personnel who are from nations under US arms embargoes or who are on the US Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List, the Axios report said.

The restrictions cover people physically in China, the Chinese government or personnel working for any organisation headquartered in China, the report added.

US officials have said that AI systems could pose national security risks, including by making it easier to engineer chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. The Biden administration in October required the makers of the largest AI systems to share details about them with the US government.

G42 earlier this year said it was actively working with U.S. partners and the UAE's government to comply with AI development and deployment standards, amid concerns about its ties to China.

Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company, the UAE's ruling family and US private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42. The company's chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE's national security advisor and the brother of the UAE's president.

 Australia PM Albanese says Musk pushing agenda for X in social media ban criticism ,"
                        
                        
                        Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday that criticism by Elon Musk of Australia's social media ban on children under 16 was the X owner pushing an agenda for the social platform, while indicating he was open to talk to the billionaire about the ban, legislated this week.

Australia approved the social media ban for children late on Thursday after an emotive debate that has gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.

The ban, which the centre-left government says is world-leading, could strain Australia's relationship with key ally the United States, where Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a ""backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians"".

Albanese, asked on Sunday if he was prepared to talk to Musk about the social media ban said: ""We'll talk to anyone"".

""With regard to Elon Musk, he has an agenda, he's entitled to push that as the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter,"" Albanese added in remarks on Australian Broadcasting Corp television.

The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta, to TikTok to stop minors logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of enforcement methods starts in January with the ban to take effect in a year.

""We are determined to get this done, the parliament has overwhelmingly passed this legislation,"" Albanese told the broadcaster.

X did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment outside of business hours.

Albanese's Labour Party won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill that was fast-tracked through the country's parliament as part of 31 bills pushed through in a chaotic final day of parliament for the year.

""Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,"" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Friday

""We're making sure that mums and dads can have that different conversation today and in future days.""

Announcing the details of the ban earlier this month, Albanese cited the risks to physical and mental health of children from excessive social media use, in particular the risks to girls from harmful depictions of body image, and misogynist content aimed at boys.

In Sydney on Friday, reaction to the ban was mixed.

""I think that's a great idea, because I found that the social media for kids (is) not really appropriate, sometimes they can look at something they shouldn't,"" said Sydney resident Francesca Sambas.

Others were more scathing.

""I'm feeling very angry, I feel that this government has taken democracy and thrown it out the window,"" said 58-year-old Shon Klose.

""How could they possibly make up these rules and these laws and push it upon the people?""

Children, meanwhile, said they would try to find a way around the ban.

""I feel like I still will use it, just secretly get in,"" said 11-year-old Emma Wakefield.

WORLD FIRST

Countries including France and some US states have passed laws to restrict access for minors without a parent's permission, but the Australian ban is absolute. A full under-14s ban in Florida is being challenged in court on free speech grounds.

Albanese's Labor party won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill that was fast-tracked through the country's parliament as part of 31 bills pushed through in a chaotic final day of parliament for the year.

The government has said enough notice was given as it first flagged the ban after a parliamentary enquiry earlier this year that heard testimony from parents of children who had self-harmed due to cyber bullying.

But it was criticised by social media firms and some lawmakers who say the bill has lacked proper scrutiny.

A spokesperson for TikTok, which is hugely popular with teen users, said on Friday the process had been rushed and risked putting children into greater danger.

""We're disappointed the Australian government has ignored the advice of the many mental health, online safety, and youth advocacy experts who have strongly opposed the ban,"" the spokesperson said.

Albanese said on Friday passing the bill before the age verification trial has been completed was the correct approach.

""We've got your back is our message to Australian parents,"" Albanese said.

""We don't argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for under 18s doesn't mean that someone under 18 never has access, but we know that it's the right thing to do.""

The ban could strain Australia's relationship with key ally the United States, where X owner Elon Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a ""backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians"".

It also builds on an existing mood of antagonism between Australia and mostly US-domiciled tech giants. Australia was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content and now plans to threaten them with fines for failing to stamp out scams.

                        Australia on Thursday passed into law a social media ban for children aged under 16 after an emotive debate that gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.

The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok to stop minors logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of methods to enforce it will start in January with the ban to take effect in a year.

The Social Media Minimum Age bill sets Australia up as a test case for a growing number of governments which have legislated or said they plan to legislate an age restriction on social media amid concern about its mental health impact on young people.

Countries including France and some US states have passed laws to restrict access for minors without a parent's permission, but the Australian ban is absolute. A full under-14s ban in Florida is being challenged in court on free speech grounds.

Getting the law passed after a marathon last day of Australia's parliamentary year marks a political win for centre-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who goes to an election in 2025 amid sagging opinion polls. The ban faced opposition from privacy advocates and some child rights groups, but 77% of the population wanted it, according to latest polls.

Against the backdrop of a parliamentary inquiry through 2024 which heard evidence from parents of children who had self-harmed due to social media bullying, domestic media backed the ban led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSA.O, the country's biggest newspaper publisher, with a campaign called ""Let Them Be Kids"".

The ban could however strain Australia's relationship with key ally the United States, where X owner Elon Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a ""backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians"".

It also builds on an existing mood of antagonism between Australia and mostly US-domiciled tech giants. Australia was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content and now plans to threaten them with fines for failing to stamp out scams.

Representatives of Meta, TikTok and X, which the government has said would be affected by the ban, were not immediately available for comment.

The companies - including Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google, whose subsidiary YouTube is exempt because it is widely used in schools - had argued the legislation should be postponed until after the age verification trial.

""It's cart before horse,"" said Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group, which has most social media companies as members.

""We have the bill but we don't have guidance from the Australian government around what are the right methods that a whole host of services subject to this law will need to employ,"" Bose added, speaking to Reuters.

NATION DIVIDED

Some youth advocacy groups and academics had warned the ban could shut off the most vulnerable young people, including LGBTQIA and migrant teenagers, from support networks. The Australian Human Rights Commission said the law may infringe human rights of young people by interfering with their ability to participate in society.

Privacy advocates meanwhile warned the law could lead to heightened collection of personal data, clearing the path for digital identification-based state surveillance. A last-minute change to the bill specified that platforms must offer an alternative to making users upload identification documents.

""This is boomers trying to tell young people how the internet should work to make themselves feel better,"" said Sarah Hanson-Young, a senator for the left-leaning Greens, in a late Senate sitting just before the bill was passed 34 votes to 19.

But parent groups pushed for intervention, seizing on comments from US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy who in 2023 said social media was worsening a youth mental health crisis to the point where it should carry a health warning.

""Putting an age limit and giving the control back to the parents, I think it's a starting point,"" said Australian anti-bullying advocate Ali Halkic, whose 17-year-old son Allem took his life in 2009 following social media bullying.

""For the 10 to 15 year olds (the ban) will be hard to manage, but the next generation who are coming up who are seven, eight or nine years old, if they don't know what it is, why is it important?"" he added in a phone interview.

Enie Lam, a Sydney school student who recently turned 16, said social media contributed to body image problems and cyber bullying but a total ban may drive young people to less visible, more dangerous parts of the internet.

""It will only create a generation of young people who will be more technologically literate in bypassing these walls,"" she told Reuters. ""It won't achieve the desired effects.""

""We all know social media isn't good for us but the social media ban generally sees a lot of young people who are strongly against it.""

 US judge rejects SEC bid to sanction Elon Musk ,"
                        
                        
                        A federal judge on Friday rejected the US Securities and Exchange Commission's request to sanction Elon Musk after he failed to appear for court-ordered testimony for the regulator's probe into his $44 billion takeover of Twitter.


US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in San Francisco said sanctions over Musk's Sept 10 absence were unnecessary, after the world's richest person testified on Oct 3 and agreed to pay the SEC's $2,923 of travel costs.


""Because the present circumstances forestall any occasion for meaningful relief that the court could grant, the SEC's request is moot,"" Corley wrote.


The SEC had sought a declaration that Musk violated a May 31 court order to provide testimony.


It said having only to repay travel costs would not deter many other people from ignoring court orders, ""much less someone of Musk's extraordinary means.""


Musk said he complied with the order by testifying on Oct 3. He is worth $321.7 billion according to Forbes magazine.


The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours. Lawyers for Musk did not immediately respond to similar requests.


Musk, whose businesses include electric car maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX and who is the world's richest person, went to Florida's Cape Canaveral on Sept. 10 to oversee the launch of SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission.


The SEC is investigating whether Musk violated securities laws in early 2022 by waiting at least 10 days too long to disclose he had begun accumulating Twitter stock.


Critics and some investors have said this let him buy shares cheaply before he eventually disclosed a 9.2 percent Twitter stake, and shortly thereafter offered to buy the whole company.


In July, Musk said he misunderstood SEC disclosure rules and that ""all indications"" suggested he made a ""mistake.""


The SEC also sued Musk in 2018 over his Twitter posts about taking Tesla private. He settled that lawsuit by paying a $20 million fine, agreeing to let Tesla lawyers review some posts in advance and stepping down as Tesla's chairman.

 US Supreme Court tosses case involving securities fraud suit against Facebook ,"
                        
                        
                        The US Supreme Court sidestepped on Friday a decision on whether to allow shareholders to proceed with a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Meta's Facebook of misleading investors about the misuse of the social media platform's user data.


The justices, who heard arguments in the case on Nov 6, dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court's ruling that allowed a 2018 class action led by Amalgamated Bank to proceed. The Supreme Court opted not to resolve the underlying legal dispute, determining that the case should not have been taken up. Its action leaves the lower court's decision in place.


The court's dismissal came in a one-line order that provided no explanation.


The Facebook dispute was one of two cases to come before the Supreme Court this month involving the right of private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud. The other one, involving the artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia NVDA.O, was argued on Nov. 13. The Supreme Court has not ruled yet in the Nvidia case.


The plaintiffs in the Facebook case claimed the company unlawfully withheld information from investors about a 2015 data breach involving British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica that affected more than 30 million Facebook users. They accused Facebook of misleading investors in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, a 1934 federal law that requires publicly traded companies to disclose their business risks.


Facebook's stock fell following 2018 media reports that Cambridge Analytica had used improperly harvested Facebook user data in connection with Donald Trump's successful US presidential campaign in 2016. The investors have sought unspecified monetary damages in part to recoup the lost value of the Facebook stock they held.


At issue was whether Facebook broke the law when it failed to detail the prior data breach in subsequent business-risk disclosures, and instead portrayed the risk of such incidents as purely hypothetical.


Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone expressed disappointment ""in the Supreme Court's decision not to clarify this part of the law.""


""The plaintiff's claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the district court,"" Stone said.


Facebook argued that it was not required to reveal that its warned-of risk had already materialised because ""a reasonable investor"" would understand risk disclosures to be forward-looking statements.


President Joe Biden's administration supported the shareholders in the case.


US District Judge Edward Davila dismissed the lawsuit but the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, prompting Facebook's appeal to the Supreme Court.


George Washington University law professor Alan Morrison said that following the Supreme Court's dismissal of Facebook's appeal, the plaintiffs would be expected to seek discovery, a process that involves the exchange of information among parties in a case. Morrison added that Facebook ""might renew their motion to dismiss under a somewhat different standard - partially for purposes of delay.""


The Cambridge Analytica data breach prompted US government investigations into Facebook's privacy practices, various lawsuits and a US congressional hearing. The US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 brought an enforcement action against Facebook over the matter, which the company settled for $100 million. Facebook paid a separate $5 billion penalty to the US Federal Trade Commission over the issue.

 Indian news agency ANI sues OpenAI for unsanctioned content use in AI training ,"
                        
                        
                        Indian news agency ANI has sued OpenAI in a New Delhi court, accusing the ChatGPT creator of using its published content without permission to help train the artificial intelligence chatbot, something that OpenAI says it has stopped doing.

ANI is the latest news organisation globally to take OpenAI to court following lawsuits in the US by newspapers including the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.

The first hearing in the case took place in the New Delhi High Court on Tuesday, where the judge issued a notice to OpenAI to provide a detailed response to ANI's accusations.

In a statement, ANI said ""the court is required to decide the legitimacy of the use of publicly available proprietary content by AI platforms.""

ANI also accused OpenAI's ChatGPT of attributing fabricated news stories to the publication, according to its court submission dated Monday, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.

The court filing contained emails sent by OpenAI's lawyers in India to ANI saying the Indian news agency's website had been placed on an internal block list since September, ceasing usage of its content in future training of AI models.

ANI, however, argues that its published works are ""permanently stored in the memory of ChatGPT"" and ""there is no programmed deletion"".

Asked about the ANI lawsuit, a spokesperson for OpenAI said in a statement: ""We build our AI models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by long-standing and widely accepted legal precedents"".

OpenAI and other tech companies have faced a wave of lawsuits by authors, visual artists, music publishers and other copyright owners for allegedly exploiting their work without permission. OpenAI has denied copyright infringement.

ANI in its filing said that OpenAI had ""refused to obtain a lawful license or permission"" for the use of original works by ANI.

The media firm is concerned about unfair competition as OpenAI has commercial partnerships with other news organisations to distribute their content, ANI said in its statement.

The AI firm has entered into licensing arrangements with news organisations such as the Financial Times and Associated Press for similar use of copyrighted content, it said.

A spokesperson for Reuters, which holds a 26% interest in ANI, said it was not involved in ANI's business practices or operations.

In its statement, OpenAI said that it was engaged in partnerships with many news organisations around the world and was holding talks to explore more, similar opportunities, including in India.

The court is set to next hear the case on Jan 28.

                        India is looking at levying import duties on some products made in the United States to counter Washington's tariffs on steel and aluminium products, a document submitted to the World Trade Organization shows.

""The proposed suspension of concessions or other obligations takes the form of an increase in tariffs on selected products originating in the United States,"" the document dated May 12 said.

It did not say what kind of products might be subjected to tariffs.

In March, the US imposed 25 percent levies on steel and aluminium imports - an extension of tariffs first imposed in 2018 during US President Donald Trump's first term.

India, the world's second-largest producer of crude steel, said in its document to the WTO that the measures would affect $7.6 billion worth of India-made products imported into the United States.

In addition to the duties on steel and aluminium, Trump's administration has threatened reciprocal tariffs of 26 percent on Indian goods. The two countries are trying to clinch a trade deal, with New Delhi offering to slash its tariff gap with the US by two-thirds.

India has some of the world's highest tariffs on imports, and Trump has previously called India a ""tariff abuser"".

India has also levied tariffs of its own on steel. Last month, it imposed 12 percent temporary tariffs to curb imports of cheap steel, primarily from China.

In addition to its attempts to stem supply domestically, New Delhi is also trying to secure greater access for Indian steel exports through trade talks with partner countries.

 US slashes 'de minimis' tariff on small China parcels to 54% ,"
                        
                        
                        The United States will cut the ""de minimis"" tariff for low-value items imported from China, a White House executive order said on Monday, further de-escalating a potentially damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies.

The tariff relief, which affects big Chinese e-commerce players including Shein and Temu, follows a deal between Beijing and Washington to unwind most of the duties imposed on each other's goods since early April, after weekend talks in Geneva.

While their joint statement in Geneva didn't mention the de minimis duties, the White House order released later said the levies will be reduced to 54 percent from 120 percent for items valued at up to $800 sent from China via postal services, with a flat fee of $100 to remain, starting from May 14.

Carriers can pay either the 54 percent or the $100 fee per package, industry experts said. The logistics companies or freight forwarders collect those tariff fees from sellers in China in advance.

The de minimis exemption allowed items valued at up to $800 and sent from China via postal service to previously enter the United States duty free and with minimal inspections.

In February, President Donald Trump ended the de minimis exemption by imposing a tax of 120 percent of the package's value or a planned flat fee of $200 - set to come into effect by June - blaming it for being heavily used by companies such as Shein, Temu and other e-commerce firms as well as traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods.

The number of shipments entering the US through the tax-free channel exploded in recent years with more than 90 percent of all packages coming via de minimis. Of those, about 60 percent came from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.

According to 2024 congressional testimony from a US Customs and Border Protection official, the average value of a de minimis shipment during fiscal year 2023 was just $54.

Chinese online retailers Shein - which is considering a London stock market listing - PDD Holdings-owned Temu and US rival Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In Monday's order, the White House said the reduced tariffs will take effect by 12:01 am (0401 GMT) on May 14, 2025.

The plan for a $200 flat fee duty rate would also be shelved, it said, keeping it at $100.

China exported $240 billion in direct-to-consumer goods benefiting from de minimis worldwide last year, accounting for 7 percent of its overseas sales and contributing 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, according to Nomura estimates.

Jianlong Hu, CEO of Brands Factory, a Chinese cross-border e-commerce consultancy, said 54 percent was still very high.

""Sellers are probably taking a wait-and-see approach but in general I think it's fair to say the boom times of small package delivery from China to the US, the Golden Age is already gone.""

Shein is more exposed to de minimis changes due to its reliance on speed of getting thousands of new styles each week to consumers in the West by air than others such as Temu.

Shein might still be one player that would want to air freight some packages from China and pay the 54 percent tariffs rather than import all by boat, said Hu.

""If people are buying clothes on Shein and are told the product will arrive one month later, who will buy that?""

LOOPHOLE

China's yuan jumped to a six-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, joining a global rally in riskier assets following the broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington.

Trump's global trade war, which shredded the playbooks that have governed international trade for decades, has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession.

The US de minimis rule, which dates back to 1938, has been the target of growing criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.

Some have derided it as a loophole that allows cheap Chinese products to flood into the United States and undercut American industries, while also serving as cover for smuggling contraband such as illegal drugs and their precursor chemicals.

De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance which describes the US waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs, was one of the most generous exemptions in the world: the EU de minimis threshold, for example, is 150 euros ($156).

The Geneva agreement slashed tariffs for both the United States and China by 115 percentage points each, to 10 percent and 30 percent, respectively, for at least 90 days.

BREATHING ROOM

The tariff pause will give online retailers like Shein and Temu breathing space to adapt their businesses, say industry experts, as online retailers are likely to use the time to bring in bulk shipments and restock their US warehouses.

Big beneficiaries of de minimis include online retailers that ship goods mainly from China, such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba's AliExpress. Their growth prompted Amazon to start its own discount service, Haul, allowing marketplace merchants to ship $5 accessories and other items directly from China using de minimis.

""I think companies that were part of the cross-border boom from China will still want to diversify their business away from the US as much as they can. Everyone has already realised if you depend on the US, it's too risky,"" said Hu of Brands Factory.

Separately, China has removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing BA.N planes in the wake of the Geneva trade deal, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Officials in Beijing have started to tell domestic carriers and government agencies this week that deliveries of aircraft made in the United States can resume, Bloomberg said.

 Private airline Novoair to resume services from May 21 ,"
                        
                        
                        After two weeks of suspension, private airline Novoair is set to resume flight services on domestic routes from May 21.

It has also offered a 15 percent discount on ticket prices in a statement on Thursday.

The airline suspended its flights on May 2, mentioning that the closure was temporary.

Mofizur Rahman, managing director of Novoair, said: ‚ÄúI am pleased to announce that we will start operating flights from next Wednesday. The flight operations were suspended as part of our business plan.

‚ÄúWe have received tremendous support and encouragement from our esteemed passengers and well-wishers during the break.‚Äù

He said, ‚ÄúWe have always been committed to better passenger service, and our priority is providing safe travel. We look forward to welcoming you all back.""

To avail a 15 percent discount on ticket prices, passengers will have to buy tickets by writing ‚ÄúVQWEBAPP‚Äù in the promo code option on Novoair's website or mobile app, the statement read.

Passengers will be able to buy tickets through Novoair's website, mobile app, Novoair sales office or the nearest travel agent from Thursday.

Rumours of Novoair winding down its business have been around for almost two years. In late January 2024, Novoair sold two ATR 72-500 aircraft to Nepal's Yeti Airlines, and they took possession of the two aircraft on Feb 1.

At the time, a Novoair official said they were selling the ATR aircraft suitable for short-haul flights to buy aircraft for long routes.

After selling those, the private airline now has five aircraft on its fleet.

Novoair started passenger transport from Dhaka to Chattogram on Jan 9, 2013.

Since then, they have operated over 100,000 flights and served more than 7.5 million passengers.

According to the fortnightly travel magazine The Bangladesh Monitor, Novoair won the ‚ÄúBest Domestic Airline‚Äù award in 2014 and 2019, and the ‚ÄúBest Ontime Performance Airline‚Äù award in 2022 and 2023.

Novoair launched international flights on the Dhaka-Kolkata route in December 2016. They suspended flights on this route for a few days during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although it was later resumed, the airline once again ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù suspended flight operations on this route on Sept 16, 2024. It is still closed.

 This US-owned factory in China made toys for Walmart. Tariffs put it on life support ,"
                        
                        
                        The emails started pouring in on April 9, the day President Donald Trump‚Äôs 145% tariff on Chinese imports took effect. Clients were cancelling orders for toys from Huntar Company Inc.‚Äôs factory in Guangdong Province, China.

But Huntar CEO Jason Cheung, 45, had already halted production at the 600,000-square-foot facility in Shaoguan. He saw the tariff for what it was: an existential threat to his company, which manufactures educational toys bound for the shelves of Walmart and Target, like Learning Resources Inc's Numberblocks, which help teach kids math.

‚ÄúI needed to start saving money as soon as possible,‚Äù Cheung said. In the four weeks since, he has cut production by 60% to 70%, laid off a third of the factory‚Äôs 400 Chinese workers, and reduced hours and wages to those still employed.

Now, he‚Äôs pursuing a frantic, long-shot effort to move his operation to Vietnam before the company his dad founded 42 years ago runs out of money.

He figures he has about a month.

Huntar‚Äôs plight typifies a crisis facing countless factories in China, where about 80% of toys sold in the US  are manufactured, according to trade group The Toy Association. New orders have fallen sharply amid a brutal trade war with the United States that threatens to devastate the sector in both countries.

Huntar is also unique in one key way: based in the US , it straddles both sides of the trade war.

On paper, Cheung is Trump‚Äôs bogeyman, the Chinese factory owner taking American jobs. But he‚Äôs also the US  small business owner tariffs were meant to protect. He's the American son of a Chinese immigrant, running a second-generation family-owned business that employs 15 people in the US  - people who would lose their jobs if Huntar falters.

Trump has said tariffs will incentivize companies to reshore manufacturing, or, at least, drive it out of China.

Huntar illustrates why economists say that‚Äôs unlikely: a dearth of facilities and workers with toy making expertise in other countries; heavy equipment that‚Äôs hard to move and would cost millions of dollars to replace; and, most acutely, no time to solve those hurdles before coffers run dry.

More likely, factories like Cheung's will simply shut down, a prospect that drove Beijing to the negotiating table with US  officials in Geneva over the weekend, three sources familiar with the Chinese government's thinking told Reuters.

Realistically, China cannot replace US  market demand for product categories like toys, furniture, and textiles, which are already feeling the impact of tariffs, one of the officials said. As trade talks began, Trump signaled he was open to cutting China tariffs to 80%.

That wouldn't help Huntar, Cheung says, noting that any tariff rate over about 50% will make survival difficult. On a practical level, there's no difference between 80% and the 145% tariffs he's currently facing.

Crises have hit Huntar before, Cheung says, but not like this. The 2008 recession brought a steady slowdown, one he could plan around. And the COVID pandemic dealt a blow, but his volume of production remained high enough to keep him afloat through a temporary slump.

This time, he says, ‚Äúour manufacturing business essentially halted overnight.‚Äù Cheung is starting to feel like his only hope is just that - hope.

‚ÄúI refresh my ‚Äòtariff‚Äô Google search five or six times a day, hoping something's changed,‚Äù he says.



A DREAM AND A LUCKY DESK

Huntar manufactures toys for US , Canadian and European sellers, like Learning Resources Inc and Play-a-Maze, which distribute them to retailers or sell directly to consumers.

It also makes its own educational toys under its Popular Playthings brand, which it has had to stop shipping to the US, costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars so far, Cheung estimates.

American-owned factories in China are uncommon, as Chinese law makes it difficult and costly for foreign entities to own them, says attorney Dan Harris, a partner at Harris Sliwoski who focuses on international manufacturing law.

But Huntar has roots in a business Cheung‚Äôs father set up in 1983, a few years after escaping communist China and settling in California‚Äôs Bay Area.

Cheung grew up in San Francisco's Inner Richmond district, he says, in a small house whose broken door you could simply kick open. His father would sell clothes and furniture at a flea market to augment his janitor‚Äôs wages, with Cheung tagging along, bored to tears.

As the operation matured, Cheung‚Äôs father set up a factory in China, to exert more control over quality. Cheung, who joined the company in 2004, still uses the desk his father set up in their living room decades ago.

‚ÄúWe think maybe it‚Äôs lucky or something,‚Äù he says.

The last few weeks have been anything but lucky. The factory is sitting on $750,000 in canceled shipments - value Cheung couldn't fully recover even if the trade war ended, because his shipping costs would surely spike as factories raced to clear backlogs. That's what happened after COVID, Cheung recalls, when shipping costs ballooned from $2,000 per container to more than $20,000.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt deserve this,‚Äù said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of toy company Learning Resources, and a client of Cheung's since his father was in charge more than 20 years ago.

Woldenberg has canceled future production in China, saying his annual tariffs would jump from $2 million to $100 million. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not who we want to be,‚Äù Woldenberg said, ‚Äúbut they know we have no choice.‚Äù

According to an April survey by the Toy Association, more than 45% of small and mid-sized toy companies in the US  say China tariffs will put them out of business within weeks or months.

Learning Resources, which employs 500 people in the US  and manufactures 60% of its products in China, has sued the US  government, asking a federal judge to stop tariffs from taking effect.

""If nothing changes, we'll be crippled,"" Woldenberg said.

‚ÄòCANNIBALIZE MYSELF‚Äô

Cheung has been scouring his contact list, calling factories in Vietnam in hopes of finding a new home for Huntar.

Moving to the US  is out of the question. Wages here are so high that manufacturing stateside would be even more expensive than staying in China and absorbing the tariffs, Cheung says.

Even in Vietnam, financial and logistical hurdles are proving too tall.

Few factories have enough space to handle his operation, and competition is high among others looking to move. Even if he found a good spot, Cheung would have to train a new staff and run safety and quality control checks that could easily take months.

There‚Äôs also the question of infrastructure. Cheung‚Äôs factory is solar-powered, helping ensure profitability in a thin-margin business. It has specific HVAC and wastewater systems designed to negate the environmental risks of spray paint and chemicals used to decorate toys. And it owns more than 30 injection machines, each weighing several tons, which craft toys by pumping molten plastic to steel casings. These likely can‚Äôt be moved, and Cheung says he‚Äôs not sure where he‚Äôd find the money - well over $1 million - to buy new ones.

A more realistic move would be to outsource certain operations and shutter others. Cheung could cut losses by finding a Vietnamese factory to take Huntar's Popular Playthings proprietary line, while ditching the business of manufacturing toys for third party clients.

Going all-in - that is, keeping his factory intact in China in hopes the trade war is resolved - is a higher-risk, higher-reward gambit. If tariffs came down quickly, his company would survive, but if they didn't, he'd lose everything. The costs of keeping a large factory running, and paying employees, while producing just a fraction of his normal output, would sink him within several weeks, he says.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm approaching this moment where I have to choose basically to cannibalize myself,‚Äù he says.

It‚Äôs hard to pare down a business that once embodied the American dream. Cheung‚Äôs father came to the US  in 1978, after escaping China by swimming across the Shenzhen River into Hong Kong - all for a shot at freedom. He ‚Äúwanted to see this business continue through me and hopefully his grandkids,‚Äù Cheung says.

His dad, he says, is feeling hopeless these days. Though grateful for the life he built here, America's sheen as a land of milk and honey has worn off. ""His idea of the US has definitely changed,"" Cheung says.

Geopolitical tensions also looked to be easing as a fragile ceasefire held between India and Pakistan, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to meet Vladimir Putin in Turkey on Thursday for talks.

Over in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touted ""substantial progress"" in trade discussions, while Chinese officials said the sides had reached ""important consensus"" and agreed to launch another new economic dialogue forum.

""What we seem to have here, then, is a broad framework under which the two nations can conduct further talks, with the aim of reaching a broader trade agreement,"" said Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone.

""Not the worst case outcome that was possible from this weekend's talks, far from it, but not a concrete deal either,"" he added. ""Does this progress allow for any tariffs to be paused, reduced, or rolled back, and if so for how long?""

Investors are hoping the White House will soon scale back the 145% tariff on Chinese goods, even if only back to the 60% first flagged by President Donald Trump.

Trump still seems wedded to keeping broad tariffs in place no matter what, which will drag on economic growth and push up prices, but any trade progress could help dodge a downturn.

Markets reacted by pushing S&P 500 futures up 1.1%, while Nasdaq futures rose 1.4%.

Nikkei futures gained 1.3% and pointed to a similar rise for the Nikkei when it opens.

The dollar added 0.4% on the safe haven yen to reach 145.90, though it was off an early five-week peak of 146.31. The euro dipped 0.2% to $1.1224 and the dollar index edged up 0.2% to 100.60.

A FRUGAL FED

Trump's erratic trade policies have put the dollar under pressure in recent weeks, though it gained some support last week when the Federal Reserve signalled it was in no rush to cut interest rates again.

Data on US consumer prices for April due this week could offer an early hint of the impact of import levies on inflation, while retail sales are seen falling back in April after a pre-tariff surge the month before.

""We expect it will not be until the May CPI data are out before we see broad evidence of tariffs showing up in inflation data,"" analysts at ANZ wrote in a note.

""In this regard, we think June is too early for the Fed to cut rates and maintain our view that Q3, and most probably September, is a more realistic time frame,"" they added. ""That would give the opportunity to observe the impact of higher tariffs on both the price level and inflation persistence.""

Markets further trimmed the outlook for easing on Monday, with Fed fund futures down between 3 and 7 ticks. The chance of a rate cut in June is now only 17%, down from more than 60% a month ago, while a July move is seen as a 59% chance.

                        US stocks ended the week on a quiet note on Friday after oscillating between slight gains and declines, as investors gauged President Donald Trump's comments on Chinese tariffs ahead of weekend trade talks between the two countries.

Wall Street's main indexes finished slightly lower for the week.

Trump said Beijing should open its market to the US and that setting 80% tariffs on Chinese goods ""seems right."" The comments marked his first specific suggestion in a change for the levies, currently at 145%.

Representatives from the two economic powerhouses are to meet in Switzerland over the weekend to discuss tariffs. Investors hope it will mark a first step toward ratcheting down a trade war that has sparked concerns over global economic growth and resurgent inflation.

""China is the main focus, and that is the one where the consequences are largest because of long-term trade practices that really need to be improved,"" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise in Troy, Michigan.

""It could go either way, because at least they're in the same room together. So regardless of whether we see that as just to get to know you a little bit better or to make some progress on an actual deal remains to be seen, but it could go either way.""

While many saw the discussions this weekend as being of a more preliminary nature, Trump said on Thursday he expects substantive talks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 119.07 points, or 0.29%, to 41,249.38, the S&P 500 lost 4.03 points, or 0.07%, to 5,659.91 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.78 points, or flat, to 17,928.92.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.47%, the Nasdaq declined 0.27%, and the Dow fell 0.16%.

Markets have been volatile since Trump first announced a slew of tariffs on countries around the globe on April 2, but stocks have rebounded to near levels seen just before the duties were announced, in part due to solid corporate earnings.

Of the 450 S&P 500 companies that reported earnings through Friday morning, about 76% topped analyst expectations. But many have also cut or withdrawn their forecasts due to the uncertain trade environment.

On Thursday, Wall Street's main indexes closed higher as investors cheered a trade deal struck between Britain and the US, the first of its kind since Trump announced a 90-day pause to his tariffs. However, a 10% baseline tariff on goods imported from the UK into the US remained in place.

Reuters reported India had offered to slash its tariff gap with the US to less than 4% from nearly 13% now, in exchange for an exemption from Trump's tariffs, according to sources.

Energy climbed 1.1% and led gains among the 11 S&P 500 sectors as oil prices rose on optimism ahead of the talks while healthcare fell 1.1% as the worst performer on the session.

Days after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, Fed policymakers on Friday pointed to increasing economic risks from Trump's tariffs, echoing comments from Chair Jerome Powell at the meeting earlier this week.

 Wary investors hope US-China talks cool high-stakes trade war ,"
                        
                        
                        Investors are hopeful that US-China trade talks this weekend will cool a trade war between the world's two largest economies and dispel some of the uncertainty clouding financial markets, though few expect a major breakthrough just yet.

The highly anticipated meeting in Switzerland could mark one of the biggest developments since US President Donald Trump launched sweeping tariffs on April 2, which threw the global trade landscape into chaos and set off extreme market volatility.

""This is the mother of all negotiations,"" said Alejo Czerwonko, chief investment officer, Emerging Markets Americas, at UBS.

""There are hundreds of billions of dollars of trade on the line, a 145% tariff on Chinese exports that amounts to some sort of de facto embargo and grievances that extend well beyond trade.""

As of 1810 GMT on Saturday, the US-China trade talks in Geneva had adjourned for the day and were set to continue on Sunday, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.

Recently, investors have expressed optimism that the worst-case trade scenarios would not come to pass, and pointed to signs of de-escalation between the US and China as a reason behind a rebound in equities.

But despite comments by Trump ahead of the talks suggesting a lower level of Chinese tariffs, and a trade deal announced on Thursday between the US and Britain, many market participants said they were not expecting major breakthroughs this weekend.

Rather, they confined themselves to hoping that nothing goes wrong when the two sides come face-to-face for the first formal round of what may be protracted negotiations.

""We're still doubtful that direct US-China negotiations will lead to a 'grand compromise',"" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie, in a note to clients.

IMMEDIATE PACT SEEN AS UNLIKELY

Both the US and China may want, or even need, to reach a deal, said Liqian Ren, director of Modern Alpha at WisdomTree Asset Management. At this early stage, however, there seems to be little incentive to do so rapidly, she added.

""Each still wants to see how the other side copes with negative headwinds,"" Ren said.

""Right now, the market is maybe a little bit too optimistic in terms of what China and the US can achieve and how fast events will move.""

Trade tensions between the two nations escalated last month, when the US boosted tariffs on all Chinese imports to a whopping 145%, and China then raised levies on US imports to 125%.

On Friday, comments by Trump that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods ""seems right"" - making his first suggestion of a specific alternative to the 145% levies - created some hope of progress toward resolving the dispute.

The benchmark S&P 500 stock index has already erased the steep losses seen in the immediate aftermath of the tariffs announcement on April 2, although businesses continue to warn investors of their impact, and the uncertainty they create, in earnings-related comments.

The S&P 500 remains down about 8% from its February all-time high and roughly 4% for the year.

Amid the tariff chaos, weak consumer sentiment surveys and other ""soft data"" have raised concerns about US growth, although most economic data has indicated resilience in the economy.

EYEING MARKET VOLATILITY

Volatility, meanwhile, remains. The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, the options-based measure of investor anxiety, hovered around 22 late on Friday - well below its recent closing high of 52.33 in early April, but above its longer-term median of 17.6.

One of the factors curbing that volatility so far has been the high cost of establishing short positions betting on future market declines, said WisdomTree's Ren.

""When a single (social media post) from the president can make the market move 10%, it becomes very costly"" to establish those positions, Ren said. Equities soared on April 9 after Trump paused many of the heftiest tariffs for 90 days.

Still, markets were poised for more volatility ahead, said Matt Gertken, head of geopolitical strategy at BCA, a macroeconomic investment research firm.

Gertken said the firm's best advice was to ""sell on strength.""

Any signs of progress in the initial discussions would be welcome, and allow China to devote more energy to its domestic economic problems, said Andrew Mattock, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia.

""To talk about any other scenario, you end up with a lose-lose outcome,"" he warned.

TOUGHEST DEAL TO NEGOTIATE

Despite the relatively fast agreement with Britain, Claudio Irigoyen, head of global economics research at BofA Securities, cautioned that other deals would be harder to hammer out, with China being the toughest.

""I can see trade deals coming with India, Japan and maybe South Korea, down the road,"" he said. ""China - this is the most complicated and will be the last one to come,"" in part because the geopolitical relationship is entangled with the trade ties.

Investors are concerned that negative scenarios have not been factored into markets.

""If we come out of Geneva with people using incendiary language and strong disagreements, I don't think that's priced in,"" said Czerwonko of UBS.

The market would probably be content with only modest signs of progress, several investors said.

""We don't need happy talk,"" said Gertken.

" Chicken prices drop but vegetables, eggs costly ","
                        
                        
                        Prices of nearly all essentials in Dhaka‚Äôs kitchen markets have either remained high or surged over the past week, except chicken.

" Bill Gates to give away $200bn by 2045, says Musk is 'killing' world's poorest children ","
                        
                        
                        Bill Gates pledged on Thursday to give away $200 billion via his charitable foundation by 2045 and lashed out at Elon Musk, accusing the world's richest man of ""killing the world's poorest children"" through huge cuts to the US foreign aid budget.

The 69-year-old billionaire co-founder of Microsoft said he was speeding up his plans to divest almost all of his fortune and would close the foundation on December 31, 2045, years earlier than previously planned. Gates said he believed the money would help achieve several of his goals, such as eradicating diseases like polio and malaria, ending preventable deaths among women and children, and reducing global poverty.

His announcement follows moves by governments, including the Trump administration, to slash international aid budgets used to prevent deadly disease and famine.

The US cuts have been overseen by Musk, who has publicly bragged about feeding the US Agency for International Development ""into the wood chipper,"" and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Around 80% of USAID programmes are set to be cut; the agency spent $44 billion worldwide in fiscal 2023.

""The picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one,"" Gates told the Financial Times.

In an interview with Reuters, Gates warned of a stark reversal to decades of progress in reducing mortality over the next four to six years due to the funding cuts by governments worldwide.

""The number of deaths will start going up for the first time ... it's going to be millions more deaths because of the resources,"" Gates told Reuters.

The Gates Foundation's annual budget will reach $9 billion by 2026 and around $10 billion annually after that due to the accelerated spending. Gates has warned the White House that his foundation and other philanthropies cannot fill the gaps left by governments.

""I think governments will come back to caring about children surviving"" over the next 20-year period though, Gates said on Thursday.

Gates and Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, once agreed over the role of the wealthy in giving away money to help others, but have since clashed several times.

Asked if he had appealed to Musk recently to change course, Gates said it was now up to Congress to decide on the future for US aid spending.

""Gates is a huge liar,"" Musk said in reply to a tweet on his X social media platform that featured an interview with Gates warning about US aid cuts. Musk's spokespeople were not immediately available for comment.

Gates said that despite his foundation's deep pockets, progress would not be possible without government support.

""There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,"" Gates wrote in a post on his website. ""It's unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people.""

He praised the response to aid cuts in Africa, where some governments have reallocated budgets, but said that, as an example, polio would not be eradicated without US funding.

Gates made the announcement on the foundation's 25th anniversary. He set up the organization with his then-wife Melinda French Gates in 2000, and they were later joined by billionaire investor Warren Buffett.

'WHAT MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME'

Since inception, the foundation has given away $100 billion, helping to save millions of lives and backing initiatives like the vaccine group Gavi and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

It will close after it spends around 99% of Gates' personal fortune, he said. The founders originally expected the foundation to wrap up in the decades after their deaths.

Gates, whose fortune iscurrently valued at around $108 billion, expects the foundation to spend around $200 billion by 2045, with the final figure dependent on markets and inflation.

The foundation hasfaced criticism for its outsized power and influence in the field without the requisite accountability, including at the World Health Organisation.

Gates himself was also subject to conspiracy theories, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

He has spoken to Trump several times in recent months, and twice since the president took office on January 20, he told Reuters on Thursday, on the importance of continued investment in global health.

""The world does have values. That's what my parents taught me,"" Gates told Reuters.

 US and Britain expected to announce tariff deal on Thursday ,"
                        
                        
                        The United States and Britain are expected to announce a deal to lower tariffs on some goods on Thursday, the first such agreement since US President Donald Trump imposed levies on countries around the world.

Trump posted on Truth Social that he would hold an Oval Office news conference at 10am EDT (1400 GMT) on Thursday about a ""major trade deal with representatives of a big, and highly respected, country.""

A British government spokesperson said Prime Minister Keir Starmer would give an update on US-UK trade talks later on Thursday. Two British people familiar with the situation said the outline of an agreement would be announced.

""The United States is an indispensable ally for both our economic and national security,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said. ""Talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace and the Prime Minister will update later today.""

A British official had said on Tuesday that the two sides were working to agree to lower tariff quotas- a tranche of exports subject to lower duties - on steel and autos, two sectors that were hit by 25 percent US levies.

In return, Britain is likely to agree to lower its own tariffs on US cars and cut a digital sales tax that affects US tech groups. It has refused to lower its food standards in order to give US producers greater market access.

The status of a 10 percent ""baseline"" tariff imposed by Trump on most countries including Britain was unclear.

Despite the potentially narrow nature of any deal, it will be politically significant for both countries.

Investors have been looking to see whether Trump can de-escalate his trade war after the launch of global tariffs risked reigniting inflation and slowing economic growth.

For Britain, the government is trying to reduce the worst of the damage from Trump's tariffs without damaging its efforts to reset its trade relationship with the European Union. It also agreed a new trade deal with India earlier this week.

Trump's trade war has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession, with central bankers and business executives wrestling with often chaotic policymaking that is hitting world supply chains and a whole host of industries.

The International Monetary Fund last month slashed its growth forecasts for the United States, China and most countries, citing the impact of US tariffs and warning that rising trade tensions would further slow growth.

US and Chinese officials are also preparing to hold talks in Switzerland on Saturday, which could mark the first step in resolving a potentially damaging trade war between the world's top two economies.

Trump's top officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the president on Apr 2 imposed the broad 10 percent tariff, along with higher ""reciprocal"" tariff rates for many trading partners, though those rates were later suspended for 90 days.

Britain was not among the countries hit with additional tariffs, because it imports more from the US than it exports there.

For Britain, the government is trying to reduce the worst of the damage from Trump's tariffs without damaging its efforts to reset its trade relationship with the European Union. It also agreed a new trade deal with India earlier this week.

Trump's trade war has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession, with central bankers and business executives wrestling with often chaotic policymaking that is hitting world supply chains and a whole host of industries.

The International Monetary Fund last month slashed its growth forecasts for the United States, China and most countries, citing the impact of US tariffs and warning that rising trade tensions would further slow growth.

US and Chinese officials are also preparing to hold talks in Switzerland on Saturday, which could mark the first step in resolving a potentially damaging trade war between the world's top two economies.

Trump's top officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the president on Apr 2 imposed the broad 10 percent tariff, along with higher ""reciprocal"" tariff rates for many trading partners, though those rates were later suspended for 90 days.

Britain was not among the countries hit with additional tariffs, because it imports more from the US than it exports there.

" APM Terminals to invest $800m in Laldiar Char terminal in Chattogram, says BIDA chief Ashik ","
                        
                        
                        Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud bin Harun has said APM Terminals, a subsidiary of Danish shipping and logistics company AP Moller-Maersk, will invest $800 million in the proposed terminal at Chattogram Port‚Äôs Laldiar Char.

Visiting the Laldia project area on Thursday, he spoke about multiple issues, including foreign investment in the port.

Ashik, who is also an executive chairman of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA), said: ""I recently visited the APM headquarters in the Netherlands. They operate ports in different countries. I believe it is one of the biggest port operators in the world.

""We‚Äôre becoming a part of history and will have a chance to make history.""

He said, ""My primary mandate is investment and job creation for Bangladesh. We always say that about 50 percent of the population of Bangladesh is under the age of 25. It is so unique, you will not find such a population in any other country in the world.

""So, to secure their future and well-being, the only way is to make our country a manufacturing hub and for that port capacity is very important.""

Referring to the discussion with the APM, the BIDA chief said: ‚ÄúThe primary assessment that they had was that it would obviously be a state-of-the-art and green port.

""It will cost them approximately $800 million, which will arrive in Bangladesh as FDI (foreign direct investment).‚Äù

Ashik continued, ‚ÄúAs you know, the FDI amount in Bangladesh is very small. Our genuine FDI, which we call equity, is not more than $700 million per year.

""So if we get $800 million in FDI through this project and we have a good company like APM, that's great for our economy and overall financial health.""

""At the same time, this company has a very good reputation globally. Their operational experience is also very good, they will bring that knowledge. This will provide employment to many.‚Äù

 Trump's movie tariff threat alarms India's film makers ,"
                        
                        
                        India's film industry, which earns roughly 40% of its overseas revenue from the United States, sounded the alarm this week about higher costs after President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of 100% on all movies produced beyond American soil.

Film makers, producers and distributors in one of the world's largest film industries by output struggled to weigh the likely impact of such a tariff as Trump provided scant details, stirring more questions than answers.

""The real question is how the term 'foreign produced' will be defined, and until that's clear, it's hard to say anything,"" said film maker Anubhav Sinha, known for his Netflix streaming series, ""IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack"".

""It's not yet clear whether services like post-production will be affected.""

India's film industry employs 272,000 people, with overseas box office takings of about 20 billion rupees ($237 million) in fiscal 2024, or a tenth of total earnings, Deloitte and studio grouping the Motion Picture Association said in a report.

Key Hollywood films with India scenes are Oscar-winners such as the rags-to-riches tale ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and the Osama bin Laden manhunt thriller, ""Zero Dark Thirty"", along with rom-com ""Eat, Pray Love"", and Batman outing ""The Dark Knight Rises"".

In the absence of details on the planned levy, film producers worry it could double the cost of exporting their films to the United States, where people of Indian descent are estimated to number 5.2 million.

""The United States is one of the most important overseas markets for Indian cinema, largely due to the substantial diaspora,"" said producer Madhu Bhojwani, reponsible for hits such as ""Airlift"", on workers evacuated from Kuwait during the Gulf War.

""Any increase in ticket prices resulting from these tariffs would directly affect audience turnout, compounding the challenges posed by evolving consumer behaviour and broader industry headwinds.""

The cost-effective South Asian nation has also grown in stature as Hollywood's preferred hub for on-ground production and post-production services, especially in visual effects, since it offers a skilled talent pool.

""Almost 10 to 15 (foreign) movies are shot in India every year, and our movie industry will be impacted very badly,"" said film trade analyst Komal Nahta.

LIKELY HIT TO REVENUE

Prominent Indian actor and producer Prakash Raj called Trump's move ""tariff terrorism"".

If the tariff covers post-production services, the consequences will be bigger, added Bhojwani, the co-founder of Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures.

""We can expect a potential decline in outsourced work from US studios to Indian vendors, which could have notable implications for the Indian media services sector,"" she said.

""If revenue from the US drops, it could affect budget planning and profitability for Indian production houses,"" said Pradeep Dwivedi, chief executive of Eros International Media.

""Big-budget films counting on overseas revenue could be restructured or scaled back.""

The move will also hurt smaller releases in the United States.

""Even a 30% drop in revenue for such mid-scale movies would be a significant dent,"" said Raj Kandukuri, producer of a well-regarded film, ""Pelli Choopulu"", in India's southern language of Telugu.

""There are a sizeable number of students in the United States who watch movies, they will not spend high on ticket prices.""

The planned levy might also drive a broader shift to digital platforms.

""US distributors might be less inclined to pick up Indian titles due to the increased cost,"" Dwivedi said.

""This could result in fewer screens, smaller releases, and a shift toward digital platforms instead of theatrical. The tariff would likely accelerate a move toward direct-to-digital releases on platforms like ErosNow, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.""

 Trade deficit shrinks to $15.43bn in nine months as imports outpace exports ,"
                        
                        
                        Bangladesh's trade deficit has reached $15.43 billion in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, reflecting a 2.03 percent decline compared with the same period last year.
Between July and March of FY 2023‚Äì24, the trade deficit stood at $15.75 billion.
Updated data released by Bangladesh Bank on Tuesday shows the country exported goods and services worth $33.87 billion during the July-March period of FY 2024-25.
In the same period a year earlier, export earnings were $30.95 billion‚Äîreflecting a growth of 9.50 percent.
Imports totalled $49.30 billion during the period, marking a 5.60 percent increase from $46.70 billion in the previous fiscal year.
CURRENT ACCOUNT
The current account deficit has narrowed in the first nine months of this fiscal year.
Up to March, the current account posted a deficit of $659 million, compared with $4.40 billion in the same period last fiscal year.
The current account reflects a country‚Äôs regular international transactions ‚Äî including export-import flows and other income-expense items.
A surplus means the country can finance its transactions without borrowing, while a deficit signals the need for external loans.
FINANCIAL ACCOUNT
The financial account posted a surplus of $1.31 billion in the July-March period.
In the same period last fiscal year, the surplus stood at $901 million.
The financial account tracks net foreign loans, assistance, foreign direct investment (FDI), and portfolio investment.
Trade credit recorded a deficit of $511 million during the first nine months, down from $2.16 billion in the same period a year ago.
The ‚Äúerrors and omissions‚Äù line, which captures unexplained capital movements, registered a deficit of $1.98 billion, up from $1.55 billion in the previous fiscal year.
WHAT ECONOMISTS SAY
Zahid Hussain, former lead economist at the World Bank‚Äôs Dhaka office, told bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúMarch saw the highest remittance inflow in history. That‚Äôs why the current account deficit dropped significantly.
‚ÄúThe financial account hasn‚Äôt changed much.‚Äù
He noted that trade credit showed a $500 million deficit in March compared with February. ‚ÄúTrade credit reflects goods loaded on ships and the bills received for them. It was lower until February but rose in March.‚Äù
According to the economist, exporters were properly repatriating their export income until February.
‚ÄúThe errors and omissions account shows a nearly $2 billion deficit. That means this amount of money has been spent, but Bangladesh Bank can‚Äôt say where it went,‚Äù he added.

 DSE sheds 149 points amid sector-wide decline ,"
                        
                        
                        The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) has suffered a massive slide as the indices fell sharply, by 149 points in a single day, following a broad-based drop in share prices across all sectors.
On Wednesday, the benchmark DSEX index fell nearly 3 percent, closing at 4,802 points. Both other key indices also finished lower.
Despite the sharp downturn, daily turnover remained relatively strong at Tk 5.16 billion.
The market began falling within the first 30 minutes of trade and continued its slide through to the closing bell.
The last time the DSE suffered a 149-point drop in a single day was on Oct 27, 2024, when the day‚Äôs turnover had dropped to Tk 3.03 billion.
That slump was deemed ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù by the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC), which had then formed a four-strong investigation committee to look into the matter.
The report from that probe is yet to be made public.
In response to the Wednesday‚Äôs plunge, BSEC spokesperson Abul Kalam gave a routine comment to bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúThe BSEC will look into the matter. The Surveillance Department continuously monitors trading.
‚ÄúIf anything unusual is found, action will be taken.‚Äù
Since Mominul Islam took over as DSE chairman on Oct 3, 2024, the bourse has witnessed two major selloffs within a span of seven months.
Multiple attempts to reach him for comment were unsuccessful.
Saiful Islam, president of the DSE Brokers Association of Bangladesh (DBA), alleged that a certain group was attempting to profit by triggering panic selling.
 ‚ÄúA panic has been created by dragging in the India-Pakistan conflict,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRumours have been spread by many. The war is in another country, but some tried to take advantage here.
‚ÄúA group got the chance to buy shares at lower prices after the drop.‚Äù
The DBA chief also pointed to an inconsistency: turnover typically drops during steep declines, yet Wednesday's trading remained active. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs also a signal,‚Äù he said.
Analysis of trading data showed total turnover reached Tk 5.16 billion, compared with Tk 5.49 billion the previous day, which had been the highest in the last two and a half months.
The banking sector accounted for 22.58 percent of the day‚Äôs total turnover, with Tk 1.13 billion worth of shares traded‚Äîwell above the usual Tk 600-800 million.
The sector had seen Tk 1.38 billion in trades the previous day, crossing the Tk 1 billion mark for two consecutive sessions.
The food and allied sector recorded the second-highest turnover at Tk 633.3 million, followed by power and energy at Tk 578.3 million.
Of the 394 issues traded, 385 lost value. Only nine advanced while five remained unchanged.
The day‚Äôs top gainers, based on closing prices, were Bashundhara Paper Mills, Midland Bank and NRB Bank.
On the losing end were Prime Textile, Beach Hatchery and MIDAS Financing.

                        Pakistan's international bonds rose on Wednesday and stocks cut hefty losses after India launched strikes on the country in response to April's tourist killings, sparking the worst fighting in over two decades between the nuclear-armed enemies.

The country's international bonds gained nearly 1 cent, reversing losses of the same amount during early trading, according to Tradeweb data. The 2031 bond, which notched the biggest gains, was bid at just over 81 cents in the dollar.

The country's benchmark share index .KSE slipped 2.2 percent, clawing back much of its losses after opening 5.78 percent lower, while the Pakistani rupee weakened a touch to stand at 281.25 to the dollar. PKR=

India said it struck nine Pakistani ""terrorist infrastructure"" sites, some of them linked to an attack by Islamist militants on Hindu tourists that killed 26 people in Indian Kashmir last month, while Islamabad said it had shot down five Indian fighter jets.

The latest escalation comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan's $350 billion economy, which has recently emerged from a crisis with the government trying to shore up finances and make progress on the $7 billion International Monetary Fund loan programme agreed in 2024.

""The reliance of Pakistan on external capital inflow ‚Äì in recovery from an external account crisis, in the midst of an IMF programme, and with under three months of import cover compared to over nine months in India ‚Äì makes its asset prices much more sensitive to any conflict than those in India,"" said Hasnain Malik at Tellimer in Dubai.

Pakistan's finance ministry said it had held an emergency meeting to review market resilience and national financial security, adding that robust measures to safeguard economic infrastructure and provide clarity and confidence to markets are being implemented, though did not give details.

IMF LIFELINE

The IMF executive board is scheduled to sign off on May 9 on a staff-level agreement that would trigger a $1 billion payout as well as Pakistan's new $1.3 billion arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme.

""Investors seem optimistic on the upcoming IMF board meeting which will decide on the loan tranche for Pakistan,"" said Sohail Mohammed, CEO of Topline Securities in Pakistan.

The IMF did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters.

The escalation follows the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India, which has sharply downgraded diplomatic links to its neighbour after the April terror attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir.

India's military hits on targets in Pakistan's most populous province of Punjab were the first since their last full-scale war more than half a century ago, triggering fears of a further escalation of military hostilities.

""The conflict between India and Pakistan has escalated dangerously,"" said Sakib Sherani, economist and head of Macro Economic Insights, adding that India's request to the IMF earlier this week to review loans disbursed to Pakistan was adding to Islamabad's woes.

""All these actions will hurt Pakistan's fragile economic recovery.""

Rating agency Moody's warned on Monday that rising tensions between the two countries could weigh on Pakistan's growth.

Others were more sanguine, saying India had also much to lose economically from an escalation in the conflict and Pakistan was in much better shape economically to weather the fallout from the tensions following recent reforms.

""Reports of the IMF program being affected purely because of representations by one country on the board of the IMF are overblown,"" said Reza Baqir, head of sovereign advisory at Alvarez & Marsal and a former Pakistan central bank chief and IMF official.

                        The US and Britain have made good progress in negotiating a trade deal that would likely include lower tariff quotas on steel and autos, a UK official said on Tuesday, but the timing of a deal remains in doubt amid conflicting signals from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and President Donald Trump.

 

Bessent told lawmakers earlier on Tuesday the Trump administration could announce trade agreements with some of the largest US trading partners as early as this week. But later Trump told reporters before a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney that he and top administration officials will review potential trade deals over the next two weeks to decide which ones to accept.

 

Since Trump announced a 90-day hiatus from stiff ""reciprocal"" tariffs he had aimed at dozens of trading partners, he and his top officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners to secure deals before the pause ends in early July.

 

US and British officials engaged in ""good discussions"" remotely over the weekend and in person this week on a range of issues, but it was too soon to say when a deal could be finalised, a UK official said.

 

""There's a landing zone,"" the official said. ""We've had good discussions this week.""

 

The talks, led on the US side by officials from the US Trade Representative's office and the Commerce Department, were expected to result in lower-tariff quotas for steel and autos, with talks still continuing about the UK digital services tax.

 

A second source familiar with the talks said the situation was encouraging, but still fluid.

 

Britain was not expected to change its phytosanitary standards which have precluded the import of some US meat products, but US officials understood there was little demand for those products in Britain at this point.

A UK government spokesperson said talks on an economic deal between the US and the UK were ongoing, but declined to set any timelines for agreement.

 Rush to beat tariffs boosts US trade deficit to record high in March ,"
                        
                        
                        The US trade deficit widened to a record high in March as businesses boosted imports of goods ahead of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which dragged gross domestic product into negative territory in the first quarter for the first time in three years.

 

The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the nation imported a record amount of goods from 10 countries, including Mexico and Vietnam. Imports from China were, however, the lowest in five years and could drop further as Trump has hiked duties on Chinese goods to a staggering 145%.

 

There are reports of a massive decline in cargo from China.

 

While reciprocal tariffs with most US trade partners were suspended for 90 days, duties on Chinese goods came into effect in early April, triggering a trade war with Beijing. Economists expect the front-running of imports probably persisted in April.

 

""Businesses are clearly scrambling as they try to find a way through this time of unprecedented change, but the worst is undoubtedly yet to come because the import tariff collections did not start to roll in earnest until after the White House 'Liberation Day' announcement on April 2,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. ""There are still no trade deals announced in Trump 2.0.""

 

The trade gap jumped 14.0%, or $17.3 billion, to a record $140.5 billion, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit would rise to $137.0 billion.

 

Imports vaulted 4.4% to an all-time high $419.0 billion. Goods imports soared 5.4% to a record $346.8 billion. They were boosted by a $22.5 billion jump in consumer goods to an all-time high, mostly made up of pharmaceutical products from Ireland. Trump has promised to impose duties on pharmaceutical goods.

 

Capital goods imports increased $3.7 billion to a record high, reflecting a solid rise in computer accessories. Imports of automotive vehicles, parts and engines increased $2.6 billion, driven by passenger cars.

 

But imports of industrial supplies declined $10.7 billion amid a $10.3 billion decrease in finished metal shapes, likely silver, and a $1.8 billion drop in non-monetary gold, which had accounted for the wider trade gap in the prior two months.

 

Economists said this data suggested capital flight out of the US dollar as the White House's ever-changing tariffs policy spooked investors. Crude oil imports fell $1.2 billion.

 

""The post-November elections period from December 2024 to March 2025 saw a cumulative hoarding of offshore gold and silver bullion on a year-over-year basis of $92.5 billion,"" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. ""This 'parking' of scarce US savings into non-productive, non-income earning assets has negative consequences for the US dollar.""

 

The dollar has weakened about 5.11% so far this year against the currencies of the main US trade partners. The currency was trading lower against a basket of currencies on Tuesday.

 

Stocks on Wall Street also fell while US Treasury yields were mixed.

 

Federal Reserve officials began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. While the US central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference will be watched for clues on when policy easing might resume.

 

 

EXPORTS RISE MARGINALLY

 

Exports climbed 0.2% to $278.5 billion, also a record high. Exports of goods increased 0.7% to $183.2 billion, the highest level since July 2022, lifted by industrial supplies and materials, which advanced $2.2 billion amid rises in natural gas and non-monetary gold.

 

Automotive vehicles, parts and engines exports increased $1.2 billion. But exports of capital goods decreased $1.5 billion, weighed down by a $1.8 billion decline in shipments of civilian aircraft. The goods trade deficit ballooned 11.2% to a record $163.5 billion in March.

 

The government reported last week that the trade deficit cut a record 4.83 percentage points from GDP last quarter, resulting in the economy contracting at a 0.3% annualised rate, the first decline since the first quarter of 2022.

 

Trump sees the tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining US industrial base. Economists expect the flood of imports to ebb by May, which could help GDP rebound in the second quarter.

 

They, however, caution that the lift from subsiding imports could be limited by a drop in exports as other nations boycott US goods and travel. There has been a decrease in the number of visitors to the US, especially from Canada, in protest over the punitive tariffs as well as an immigration crackdown and Trump's musings about annexing Canada and Greenland.

 

Indeed, exports of services fell $0.9 billion to $95.2 billion in March, pulled down by a $1.3 billion drop in travel.

 

The rush to beat tariffs saw imports from Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, India and Vietnam hitting all-time highs. But imports from China were the lowest since March 2020, when the world was grappling with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

The seasonally adjusted goods trade deficit with China narrowed to $24.8 billion from $26.6 billion in February. The trade deficit with Canada also declined to $4.9 billion from $7.4 billion in February. The trade gap with Mexico was little changed, while the surplus with the UK narrowed.

 

""Imports from the EU were substantial in March, particularly from Ireland, and may decline in April,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. ""But if anything, imports from some Asian countries may rise further as larger 40%-50% tariffs were delayed until July.""

The DSEX, the benchmark index, shed 12.94 points on Tuesday, closing at 4951 points. It had hit 4,964 points on Monday.

Trading began on a negative note on Tuesday morning, as the DSEX lost eight points inside the first hour. Trade volume then rose for banks and mutual funds as the key index recovered lost points.

As trading climbed in the country‚Äôs premier bourse, the index neared 5,000 points around 11:45am, but the momentum was short-lived due to selling pressure. The market went into correction in the final hours of the day.

In terms of closing numbers, the banking sector drove 27 percent of the trading as shares worth Tk 1.38 billion changed hands in the sector, which usually registers trading worth Tk 600-800 million. On Monday, the banking sector posted Tk 745 million in turnovers.

Of the 61 commercial banks, 36 are listed in the capital market and among them, 17 have finalised their 2024 financial report and declared the investors‚Äô dividend. Seven of these banks reported satisfactory profits while deposits exceeded expectations for some others.

At this time of the year, investors look forward to banks‚Äô dividend declaration, which shapes their decision to make changes in their investment plans.

However, Bangladesh Bank has not yet approved the annual reports of 19 banks. These banks were supposed to reach a decision on dividends in board meetings held on Apr 30, but their discussions were inconclusive and annual reports were not delivered.

Following media reports on the issue, the banks officially informed investors about this in an announcement.

As investors investigated the matter on Monday, the turnover in the sector surged on Tuesday. The share prices of 27 banks soared, registering a 75 percent rise.

On the other hand, the share prices of 26 mutual funds surged, posting a 72 percent rise.

According to DSE data, the share prices of most companies declined on Tuesday. Of the 397 listed companies and funds, 116 rose in price, 253 dropped, while 28 traded at the previous price.

Based on closing prices, Baraka Power, NRB Bank and Bashundhara Paper Mill emerged as the top gainers on the DSE, while Khulna Printing and Packaging, Khulna Power Company and Haqqani Pulp were the biggest losers.

" OpenAI dials back conversion plan, nonprofit to retain control ","
                        
                        
                        OpenAI has dialed back a significant restructuring plan, with its nonprofit parent retaining control in a move that is likely to limit CEO Sam Altman's power over the pioneering maker of ChatGPT.

The announcement follows a storm of criticism and legal challenges, including a high-profile lawsuit filed by rival and co-founder Elon Musk, who has accused OpenAI of straying from its founding mission to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity.

""OpenAI was founded as a non-profit, is today a non-profit that oversees and controls the for-profit, and going forward will remain a non-profit that oversees and controls the for-profit. That will not change,"" Altman said in a blog post on Monday.

OpenAI had outlined plans in December to convert its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation, a structure designed to balance shareholder returns with social goals, unlike nonprofits, which are solely focused on public good. Under that proposal, the nonprofit parent would have been a big shareholder in the PBC but would cede control over the startup.

On Monday, OpenAI said the nonprofit parent would continue to control the PBC and become a big shareholder in it. The company will push ahead with plans to change the structure of its for-profit arm to allow more capital-raising to keep pace in the AI race.

The move to an outright for-profit was intended to help OpenAI raise more capital and ease restrictions tied to its nonprofit parent. But it sparked concerns over whether the company would fairly allocate assets to the nonprofit and how it would balance profit-making with its mission to develop AI for the public good.

""We made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware,"" Bret Taylor, chairman of OpenAI's board, said in a blog post, adding that the new announcement meant the startup would continue to have a structure ""extremely close"" to the current one.

Altman called the move a compromise ""that (works) well enough for investors that they're happy to continue to fund us to a degree we think we will need."" He said OpenAI would work with major backer Microsoft, regulators and newly appointed nonprofit commissioners to finalise the updated plan.

""We believe this is well over the bar of what we need to be able to fundraise,"" Altman said, adding there were ""no changes to any existing investor relationships"" and that the company would remove caps on the profit that investors can earn. He noted that public benefit corporations have become common at AI companies including rivals such as Anthropic, which is backed by Amazon as well as Alphabet's Google, and at Musk's xAI.

But some questions remain over what exactly was changing and whether the move made it harder for OpenAI to raise capital as aggressively as it might have under a more conventional corporate structure.

""We‚Äôre glad that OpenAI is listening to concerns from civil society leaders ... but crucial questions remain,"" said Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics adviser, and lead organiser of the group Not For Private Gain.

""Will OpenAI's commercial goals continue to be legally subordinate to its charitable mission? ... Who will own the technology that OpenAI develops? The 2019 restructuring announcement made the primacy of the mission very clear, but so far, these statements have not,"" he said. He added he was concerned that in the current PBC structure, the board would be obligated to maximise shareholder value.

EXPENSIVE AI

As the expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses human intelligence, heats up, OpenAI has been looking to make changes to attract further investment.

It announced in March it would raise up to $40 billion in a new funding round led by SoftBank Group, at a $300 billion valuation. The round was contingent on the AI firm transitioning to for-profit status by the end of the year, a structure that drew attention in November 2023 during one of the biggest boardroom dramas in Silicon Valley, where members of the nonprofit board ousted Altman over a breakdown in communication and loss of trust. He was reinstated after five days, following an outpouring of support from employees and investors.

Altman said OpenAI would still be able to receive funding from the Japanese tech investor after Monday's move.

SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Microsoft declined to comment.

The announcement also raised questions over the future of Musk's lawsuit which sought to block OpenAI‚Äôs transition away from nonprofit control, among other claims. A jury trial had been scheduled for March 2026.

A consortium led by Musk had also made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI earlier this year that was swiftly rebuffed by Altman with a ""no thank you.""

                        The Bangladesh AI Summit, organised by the Bangladesh Brand Forum (BBF), will be held at BRAC University on May 8.
A landmark initiative in the country‚Äôs digital transformation journey, the summit is a flagship initiative of the Bangladesh Innovation Conclave (BIC), the BBF said in a statement on Monday.
As Bangladesh positions itself to become a digitally advanced economy, the endeavour aims to harness the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for business, governance, and societal development, the think tank added.
The conference, powered by AKIJ Resource & Mutual Trust Bank PLC and in collaboration with BRAC Business School, will bring together global and local industry leaders, policymakers, and innovators to share insights and best practices; showcase groundbreaking AI applications; foster collaboration across sectors; and build a robust talent pipeline for AI in Bangladesh.
The initiative strives to generate greater awareness of AI's potential, stronger public-private-academic partnerships, with an expanded pool of AI-skilled professionals, and actionable policy insights to guide the development of a national AI strategy, the statement read.
Shariful Islam, founder and managing director of BBF and BIC, said: ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence is reshaping the world around us. As Bangladesh strives to become a digitally advanced economy, the role of AI will be central to how we educate, govern, heal, farm, manufacture, and live.
‚ÄúThrough this summit, we will seek to explore how AI can unlock transformative change in our industries, enhance governance, improve lives, and build a more inclusive and ethical society.
We are also proud to initiate the AI Hackathon, a competition that has provided our brightest minds a platform to build solutions to some of our most pressing challenges.‚Äù
ICT Division Secretary Shish Haider Chowdhury will inaugurate the summit and retired maj general Emdad ul Bari, chairman of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), will share his insights as the closing chief guest of the inaugural ceremony.
The summit will feature a dynamic agenda comprising four keynote sessions, two panel discussions, five insight sessions, two case studies, and a fireside chat. 
Alongside the sessions, the summit will host five breakout sessions with industry experts to deepen discussions on AI integration in pivotal areas ‚Äì manufacturing, education, agriculture, fintech and healthcare.
Pivotal topics to explore during the keynote sessions will include the future of AI in Bangladesh, the global AI shift and its implications for emerging economies, the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, and the democratisation of AI for societal advancement.
Other knowledge sessions will explore how AI can support national development through ethical policy-making and enhance access to financial services, the contrast between hype and reality in the local AI landscape, how AI is revolutionising agriculture through AgriTech solutions, the importance of making AI accessible for broader community impact, how businesses are rethinking processes and models using AI, and how ethically designed AI systems can contribute to a more just and inclusive world.
The summit, including the AI Hackathon Award Ceremony, will mark the successful conclusion of the AI Hackathon, another groundbreaking initiative of the BIC.
The award will be presented to six AI-based solutions featuring 6 critical sectors: city management, manufacturing, education, agriculture, fintech, and healthcare.
The AI Hackathon was launched on Mar 10 with the goal of developing AI-driven solutions for urban and sector-specific challenges in Bangladesh.
The competition, which attracted 177 team submissions from 70 organisations, shortlisted 31 teams on Apr 16.
The selected teams worked on their prototypes from Apr 17 to May 5, leading to a two-day boot camp and final showcase event on May 6‚Äì7 at BRAC University.
Throughout the boot camp, participants will receive mentoring from industry experts and ultimately pitch their solutions.

 Dhaka stock turnovers soar close to Tk 6bn in recovery ,"
                        
                        
                        The key index on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) has surged as the market posted its highest turnovers in almost two and a half months, soaring close to Tk 6 billion. 

The last time trading volume passed Tk 5.84 billion was Feb 25. That day trading reached Tk 6.07 billion, with the index standing at 5,267 points.

Trading started on a positive note on Monday morning with volume rising along with the index.

Although the market went into correction in the final hours of the day, the benchmark index DSEX closed by adding 8 points to where it stood on Sunday, at 4,964.

The trade volume rose significantly as shares worth Tk 5.84 billion changed hands compared with Sunday‚Äôs Tk 3.99 billion.

The DSE sustained an overall negative trend through March with trade volume falling from Tk 5 billion to Tk 4 billion, mostly trading around the lower threshold.

On Apr 10, turnover spiralled downward to around Tk 3 billion, plummeting to Tk 2.91 billion on Apr 29 for the second-lowest trade over the past five months.

The index continued a declining trend, sometimes climbing into a mixed trend but it was short-lived.

This brought about a fall in the share prices of small to medium-sized companies as well as multinational and fundamental companies as investors kept losing capital.

Investors in banks, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, and fuel and power sectors, which are usually at the top of DSE trades, then cut down on trading.

Despite this, a small number of investors in the insurance, banking, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, and textile sectors drew profits, but it had little impact on DSE‚Äôs overall index.

Investors in mutual funds and textile sectors drew the highest gains in DSE trading on Monday.

According to DSE data, with share prices for most companies trending up, 173 of the 400 listed companies and funds rose in prices, 169 dropped, while 58 remained at the previous price.

Banking, food and allied, and power and electricity sectors drove the market‚Äôs trade recovery.

Based on closing prices, Bashundhara Paper Mill, Baraka Power and SEML PBSL Growth Fund topped the list of gainers, while Khulna Power Company, Renwick Jajneswar and Energypac Power Generation were the biggest losers.

 Trump says Hollywood 'dying'; orders 100% tariff on non-US movies to save it ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump on Sunday announced a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the country, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering to lure filmmakers.

""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,"" Trump said on Truth Social.

Trump said he was authorising the relevant government agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, to immediately begin the process of imposing a 100% tariff on all films produced abroad that are then sent into the United States.

He added: ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!""

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X: ""We're on it.""

Neither Lutnick nor Trump provided any details on how the tariffs would be implemented.

It was unclear if the tariffs would apply to movies on streaming services as well as those shown in theaters, or if they would be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue. Hollywood executives were trying to sort out details on Sunday night. The Motion Picture Association, which represents the major studios, had no immediate comment.

In Jan, Trump appointed Hollywood veterans Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson to bring Hollywood back ""bigger, better and stronger than ever before.""

Movie and TV production has been exiting Hollywood for years, heading to locations with tax incentives that make filming cheaper.

Governments around the world have increased credits and cash rebates to attract productions and capture a greater share of the $248 billion that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.

All major media companies, including Walt Disney, Netflix and Universal Pictures CMCSA.O, film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain.

Shares in Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global and Amazon.com were lower in early trade on Monday.

On Monday, leaders in Australia and New Zealand responded to Trump's tariff announcement by saying they would advocate for their local industries. Some Marvel superhero movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was the backdrop for ""The Lord of the Rings"" films.

The British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the government to move swiftly to protect the country's ""vital"" film industry.

""These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering,"" said Bectu head Philippa Childs.

She said they would also threaten tens of thousands jobs of freelancers who make films in the UK.

Film and high-end TV production in the UK was worth 5.6 billion pounds ($7.45 billion) in 2024, a 31 percent increase on 2023, according to the British Film Institute.

The government's Department for Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

'LOT MORE TO LOSE THAN TO GAIN'

In 2023, about half of the spending by US producers on movie and TV projects with budgets of more than $40 million went outside the US, according to research firm ProdPro.

Film and television production has fallen by nearly 40 percent over the last decade in Hollywood's home city of Los Angeles, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region's production.

The January wildfires accelerated concerns that producers may look outside Los Angeles, and that camera operators, costume designers, sound technicians and other behind-the-scenes workers may move out of town rather than try to rebuild in their neighborhoods.

A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most preferred place to film in the next two years, behind Toronto, Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia.

Hollywood producers and labour unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state's tax incentives to better compete with other locations.

Trump's proposed movie tariff follows a series of trade conflicts initiated by his administration, which have roiled markets and led to fears of a US recession.

Former senior Commerce official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump's film tariffs would be devastating.

""The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,"" he said, adding it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.

 Berkshire investors anticipate new era as Buffett hands over baton ,"
                        
                        
                        Berkshire Hathaway shareholders mourning the departure of legendary investor Warren Buffett anticipate the conglomerate he built over 60 years will retain its long-term focus and culture but worry about the loss of Buffett's vision and star power.

 

Following Buffett's surprise announcement on Saturday that he would step down as chief executive by the end of the year, Berkshire shareholders and fans said the Omaha, Nebraska-based company will remain in good hands once Vice Chairman Greg Abel takes the top job.

 

But they said it remains unclear how the $1.16 trillion conglomerate, which has 189 operating businesses, $264 billion of stocks and $348 billion of cash, will fare after the man so intertwined with it leaves the stage. Buffett made the announcement at the end of the Berkshire annual meeting after hours of taking shareholder questions. He said Berkshire‚Äôs board of directors will meet on Sunday to discuss the transition.

 

""There has been a premium on Berkshire because of Buffett,"" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert. ""Will people look at it in the same way?""

 

Richard Casterline, a computer programmer from Denver, said it was a ""bit shocking"" to learn of Buffett's departure.

 

""I'm curious to see what the stock price will do on Monday,"" he said. ""I don't think (Abel) elicits the same excitement. It's not any fault of his own, it's just thinking of who could be as legendary as those two are. It's just tough shoes to fill.""

 

BUFFETT'S BABY

 

Still, many see Abel as right for the job.

 

""This is Buffett's baby, and he thoughtfully and deliberately planned for an orderly succession that does not disrupt the value of his life's work,"" said Daniel Hanson, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. ""I have full confidence in Greg's leadership.""

 

Richard Lancaster, an accounting consultant from Charlotte, North Carolina, likened the change to Steve Jobs handing Apple's reins to current Chief Executive Tim Cook in 2011.

 

""You have two different personalities, two different approaches,"" said Lancaster. ""Greg has all the qualities Warren likes in a manager: very sharp individual, and well-versed in what's in the business climate today and the changes that will come through disruptive technologies.""

 

Under Buffett, Berkshire's annualised shareholder return has roughly doubled that of the Standard & Poor's 500lt.

 

Buffett's aura was such that when Berkshire disclosed new common stock investments, it routinely sent the stock prices higher even if Buffett himself wasn't doing the investing.

 

Some analysts believe Abel may be more hands-on than Buffett in overseeing Berkshire's subsidiaries.

 

""Abel's going to have to tread a fine line between maintaining a Buffett-like environment, with also making his mark,"" said analyst Cathy Seifert at CFRA Research.

 

And some investors clamor for Berkshire to pay a dividend, which it has not done since 1967.

 

ABEL'S WAY

 

Abel has hinted at changes.

 

Prior to Buffett's announcement, which Abel hadn't known was coming, the vice chairman told annual meeting attendees he would be ""more active, but hopefully in a very positive way,"" in overseeing Berkshire subsidiaries, though they would continue running ""very autonomously.""

 

Berkshire's businesses are diverse, including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, many utility and power companies, a real estate brokerage, and retail brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies.

 

Another possible change: how readily Berkshire will unload businesses it owns, including when they underperform.

 

Buffett is known as a collector of businesses but has made exceptions, as when businesses lose competitive advantages.

 

In 2019, Berkshire sold its Applied Underwriters workers compensation unit, and the next year shed its newspaper empire as falling ad revenue led Buffett to brand the industry ""toast.""

 

Leaders of most Berkshire businesses have since 2018 reported to Abel, while Berkshire's insurance businesses such as Geico, General Re and National Indemnity have reported to Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, which they will continue doing.

 

Managers praise Abel as a quick study, despite overseeing businesses as varied as aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, Israeli toolmaker Iscar and Borsheims jewelry.

 

Quick changes are unlikely. Berkshire's sheer size makes undoing Buffett's work in short order, or making a transformational acquisition, very difficult.

 

""Buffett has built such an amazing machine,"" said Nate Garrison, chief investment officer at World Investment Advisors. ""It's something that will stand the test of time.""

 

LONG LEGACY

 

Shareholders said Buffett's legacy will live on.

 

Sameer Naik, a software architect from Omaha, said Buffett taught investors to be patient when investing.

 

""His biggest legacy is giving investors a lot of confidence they can get rich, slower,"" Naik said. ""If you invest in the right companies that you understand, and invest over time, good things will happen.""

 

Pamela Taylor, a Chicagoan who works in technology sales, said she has studied Buffett's investing style for a long time.

 

""His strategy of buy-and-hold in particular can be very different from the quick-sell technique that other investors use,"" she said. ""That will be his legacy.""

 

One thing many shareholders expect will be downsized is Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend, which draws tens of thousands to Omaha for shopping and other events, including the annual meeting.

 

""It is an opportunity to interact with other people with the same moral compass,"" said Robert O'Connor, a family doctor from Victoria, British Columbia. ""It's our Coachella.""

 Bangladesh cuts 12kg LPG cylinder price by Tk 19 ,"

Each 12kg cylinder will now cost Tk 1,431, effective from 6pm, the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) said on Sunday.

Bangladesh imports propane and butane, the main components of LPG, from abroad. BERC adjusts the price of LPG in the domestic market based on the cargo price of Saudi Arabia's state-owned company Aramco.

Aramco set the average price of propane and butane at $597 per ton, BERC said.

The retail price of LPG per kg has been fixed at Tk 119.24, which was Tk 120.80 in the previous month.

Accordingly, a 5.5kg cylinder of LPG has been fixed at Tk 656, 15kg at Tk 1789, 20kg at Tk 2385, 25kg at Tk 2981, 30kg at Tk 3577, 35kg at Tk 4173, and 45kg at Tk 5366.

At the consumer level, the price of each litre of autogas has also been cut from Tk 66.41 to Tk 65.57, while the price of reticulated gas has been fixed at Tk 115.49.

" Shell is studying merits of buying BP, Bloomberg News reports ","
                        
                        
                        Shell Plc is working with advisers to evaluate a potential acquisition of rival BP Plc, though it is waiting for further stock and oil price declines before deciding whether to pursue a bid, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday citing people familiar with the matter.

The oil major has been more seriously discussing the feasibility and merits of a takeover with its advisers in recent weeks, the report said, adding that any final decision will likely depend on whether the rival's stock continues to slide.

For several years, BP and Shell were almost equal in size, but over the past few years Shell has grown to almost twice the size of BP, with a market value of about 149 billion pounds.

On Friday, when asked about a possible takeover bid for BP, Shell's, Chief Executive Wael Sawan told the Financial Times he would rather buy back more Shell stock. A Shell spokesperson confirmed the comments.

When asked on an earnings call about Shell's capacity to launch sizable acquisitions, he said ""we have to have our own house in order"" and have ""more work to do"" despite progress over the last couple of years.

A takeover of its cross-town London rival would make Shell an even bigger force in the global energy industry, giving it scale to rival the likes of Exxon and Chevron. A merger would also likely certainly invite regulatory scrutiny, considering the size of the deal.

Shell this week reported strong first-quarter results surpassing profit expectations and launched a $3.5 billion share buyback.

Shell may also wait for BP to reach out or for another suitor to make a first move, and its current work could help it get prepared for such a scenario, some of the people told Bloomberg News.

Deliberations are in the early stages and Shell may opt to focus on share buybacks and bolt-on acquisitions rather than a megamerger, the report added.

""As we have said many times before we are sharply focused on capturing the value in Shell through continuing to focus on performance, discipline and simplification,"" a Shell spokesperson said when asked about the report. BP declined to comment.

Under pressure to improve profitability and cut costs, BP chief Murray Auchincloss has announced plans to sell $20 billion of assets through to 2027, reduced spending and share buybacks. It also announced the departure of its strategy chief as it tries to shore up investor confidence.

Activist investor Elliott Investment Management had wanted a change of strategy chief as it seeks higher free cash flow through deeper cuts to spending and costs, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

It has increased its stake in BP to just over 5%, placing it between top shareholders BlackRock and Vanguard, according to a regulatory filing.

" Buffett to step down as Berkshire CEO after 60 years at helm, passes baton to Abel ","
                        
                        
                         

Warren Buffett is ending his career as perhaps the world's most famous and revered investor, saying he will step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of 2025, and hand over the reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel.

The move caps an era for Berkshire after Buffett's extraordinary 60 years at the helm, which made him a household name, a multi-billionaire and an American success story.

""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,"" Buffett, 94, said on Saturday as he wrapped up Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, adding he would still ""hang around and conceivably be useful in a few cases"" but that the ""final word"" would be Abel's.

The announcement prompted an outpouring of praise for Buffett from CEOs and investors.

""Warren Buffett represents everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself - investing in the growth of our nation and its businesses with integrity, optimism, and common sense,"" said Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, in a post on X said: ""There's never been someone like Warren, and countless people, myself included, have been inspired by his wisdom. It's been one of the great privileges of my life to know him.""

Buffett's move will propel Abel into the spotlight at Berkshire. Abel, who has long been identified by Berkshire to be Buffett's successor, may not have the star power of Buffett although he is expected to preserve the culture of the conglomerate.

Buffett said Abel and most of Berkshire's board of directors hadn't been aware of his plans prior to the announcement, though Buffett had told his two children who are directors. Berkshire‚Äôs board of directors will meet on Sunday to discuss the transition, he said.

Abel, 62, has been a Berkshire vice chairman since 2018, and was named Buffett's expected successor as chief executive in 2021.

""I couldn't be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forth,"" Abel told shareholders.

Buffett also said he had ""zero"" intention of selling any of his Berkshire stock, nearly all of which will be donated after his death.

""The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg's management than mine,"" Buffett said.

REMARKABLE RUN

The decision to step down caps a remarkable 60-year run where Buffett transformed Berkshire from a failing textile company into a $1.16 trillion conglomerate with businesses across the US economy.

Buffett's own fortune totals $168.2 billion according to Forbes magazine, nearly all of which is in Berkshire stock.

Cole Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management, said after Buffett's announcement he turned to his father Bill Smead, who founded the firm, and said: ""Well, it's the end of an era. It's sad, but it's life.""

Berkshire's stock price has risen 19 percent this year, compared with a 3 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500.

Many investors have viewed the conglomerate and Buffett's stewardship as a safe haven from uncertainty about the economy and US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

""The question going forward is: will Berkshire still have a Buffett premium when Buffett is not there?"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. ""You're buying a stock and you're also getting the investing prowess of a legend. With that legend gone, what is the value?""

'GREG CAN DO BETTER'

Abel had already been taking on many of Buffett's responsibilities, including for capital allocation.

Asked during the meeting how his oversight of Berkshire's 189 operating businesses would differ from Buffett's, Abel said: ""More active, but hopefully in a very positive way.""

Buffett said Berkshire's board could make arrangements for the transfer of power over the next few months, and he could ""conceivably be useful in a few cases"" after Abel takes over.

""The fact that you can do pretty well doesn't mean you couldn't do better, and Greg can do better,"" Buffett told shareholders before the announcement.

Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend, which Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" annually draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha for the meeting and for a series of shareholder events across the city, including shopping.

The company has said it intends to continue holding the weekends. Many shareholders have said they will keep attending after Buffett leaves, though many believe attendance will drop.

Buffett took over Berkshire in 1965 and with his longtime friend and business partner Charlie Munger, who died in November 2023, built it into an American success story.

Headquartered in Omaha, where Buffett and Munger grew up, Berkshire now has close to 200 businesses including Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, industrial and chemical companies, utilities, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and See's Candies.

It also ended March with $264 billion of stocks including Apple, American Express and Bank of America.

'ORACLE OF OMAHA'

Buffett became known as the ""Oracle of Omaha"" for his investing success as well as his folksy wisdom and modest lifestyle.

While Berkshire stock rose 5,502,284 percent from 1965 to 2024, Buffett never moved from a home he paid $31,500 for in 1958.

Buffett was a disciple of Benjamin Graham, the economist and his former professor, stressing the importance of company fundamentals and not overpaying for assets.

That approach often made it hard to deploy Berkshire's ever-growing cash hoard, which reached $347.7 billion at the end of March.

Abel joined the former MidAmerican Energy, now known as Berkshire Hathaway Energy, in 1992, eight years before Berkshire took it over. He later led that business for a decade.

Buffett's fortune would have been much bigger had he not since 2006 given away more than half his Berkshire shares to charity.

Nearly all of the rest is expected to go into a new charitable trust overseen by his daughter Susie and sons Howard and Peter.

Abel will face challenges including how to help Berkshire grow meaningfully without overpaying for acquisitions, whether to pay a dividend and how to deploy the cash.

Howard Buffett, 70, is expected to eventually succeed his father as Berkshire's non-executive chairman, to help preserve the company's culture.

 19 banks fail to declare dividends as Bangladesh Bank holds back approvals ,"
                        
                        
                        A total of 19 listed banks have failed to declare dividends despite holding board meetings at the end of the fiscal year due to the absence of final approval from Bangladesh Bank on their annual financial reports.

Listed on the capital market, these banks could not finalise their financial reports for the 2024 accounting year, preventing them from preparing unaudited statements for the first quarter of 2025.

As a result, investors remain unaware of the banks' year-end dividends and financial performance.

With over seven months having passed since the last available reports for the third quarter, the latest financial data remain unavailable.

According to officials from both the central bank and the relevant banks, the reports failed to secure approval due to multiple issues.

These include inadequate provisioning against actual defaulted loans and the failure to disclose the full extent of such loans.
Officials also cited the absence of Bangladesh Bank chief Ahsan H Mansur, who was abroad until Apr 30, as a reason for the delay.

The governor returned from the United States last Thursday after attending an International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting, and bankers now seek guidance once his office resumes normal operations.

Many opted for late evening meetings, but several of them concluded without decisions as they did not receive the required No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the central bank, even after waiting into the night.

Islami Bank Bangladesh had initially scheduled its board meeting for Apr 28 to finalise the annual and Q1 reports. Failing to receive the NOC, it rescheduled the meeting for Apr 30.

" Apple shares fall as buyback cuts, tariff fears fan investor jitters ","
                        
                        
                        Apple shares fell 5 percent on Friday after the company trimmed its stock buyback programme and CEO Tim Cook flagged a $900 million tariff-related hit to costs this quarter amid a raging Sino-US trade war.

US President Donald Trump's tariff flip-flops have thrown corporate plans into disarray, even for Apple, which along with Microsoft, has been juggling the title of the world's most valuable company.

The company has been stocking up to cushion the blow from potential supply-chain snarls and rising US import costs. But with consumer confidence sliding, some analysts said Apple may face weakening iPhone demand in its home market.

Its decision to lower its buyback authorisation by $10 billion also marked a rare pullback that signaled a desire to preserve cash in the face of uncertainty. Typically it has either maintained or increased its repurchase levels.

""The $100 billion buyback announced is below the $110 billion announced a year ago, which we found as a bit of a head-scratcher, as Apple historically either holds its buyback or increases it authorization,"" said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at CFRA Research.

Analysts have warned US tariffs on China could drive up iPhone prices, if Apple chose to pass on the added costs to consumers. But, Cook said most of the devices sold in the US this quarter would be manufactured outside China.

A last-minute exemption for consumer electronics has also offered temporary relief, even as the White House continues to weigh further trade actions.

Cook said on Thursday Apple is ramping up efforts to shift its supply chain away from China, with most US-bound iPhones now set to be assembled in India.

Apple reported quarterly sales of $95.36 billion and earnings of $1.65 per share, narrowly beating market expectations. The company forecast low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth, in line with muted expectations.

In China, Apple posted $16 billion in revenue, slightly above forecasts, though competition from Huawei and slower AI rollout continue to pressure market share.

If losses hold, Apple is on track to shed more than $150 billion in market value, while a bullish outlook from Microsoft earlier this week has helped the Windows-maker become the world's most valuable company.

SHIFTING SUPPLY CHAIN

Cook said Apple's shift away from manufacturing in China would include sourcing more chips from the US and expanding its footprint in key states like Texas, Arizona, and Oregon, but acknowledged the transition comes at a cost.

""Having everything in one location had too much risk,"" he told analysts, referring to Apple's historical dependence on Chinese manufacturing.

Apple's move to import iPhones from India marks a further shift in its production strategy, aimed at sidestepping future tariffs while expanding its presence in a fast-growing emerging market.

""Part of their long-term vision is a big portion of the supply chain being in India,"" said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds, which owns Apple shares.

""I think just kind of having that base there would also do well for their relations or their prestige in the country.""

 China 'evaluating' US offer to negotiate tariffs; Beijing's door is 'open' ,"
                        
                        
                        Beijing is ""evaluating"" an offer from Washington to hold talks over US President Donald Trump's crippling tariffs, China's Commerce Ministry said on Friday, signalling a potential de-escalation in the trade war that has roiled global markets.

 

The United States has approached China to seek talks over Trump's 145% tariffs and Beijing's door was open for discussions, the commerce ministry said.

 

The US should be prepared to take action in ""correcting erroneous practices"" and cancel unilateral tariffs, the commerce ministry said in a statement, adding that Washington needed to show ""sincerity"" in negotiations.

 

""The US has recently taken the initiative on many occasions to convey information to China through relevant parties, saying it hopes to talk with China,"" the statement said, adding that Beijing was ""evaluating this"".

 

""Attempting to use talks as a pretext to engage in coercion and extortion would not work,"" it added.

 

China has repeatedly denied it is seeking to negotiate a way out of the tariffs with the United States, appearing instead to be betting that Washington makes the first move.

 

Trump's decision to single Beijing out for import duties of 145% comes at a particularly difficult time for China, which is struggling with deflation due to sluggish economic growth and a prolonged property crisis.

 

Beijing has expressed its anger at the tariffs, which it says are tantamount to bullying and cannot stop the rise of the world's second-largest economy.

 

Alongside leveraging its propaganda machine to hit back at the duties, China has quietly created a list of US-made products it will exempt from its retaliatory 125% tariffs - including select pharmaceuticals, microchips and jet engines - Reuters has reported.

 

On the US side, officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, have also expressed hope for progress in easing trade tensions.

 

""I am confident that the Chinese will want to reach a deal. And as I said, this is going to be a multi-step process. First, we need to de-escalate, and then ... we will start focusing on a larger trade deal,"" Bessent said in an interview with Fox Business Network this week.

 

Trump said on Wednesday he believed there was a ""very good chance"" his administration could do a deal with China, hours after Chinese President Xi Jinping called on officials to take action to adjust to changes in the international environment, without explicitly mentioning the United States.

" Apple girds for more trade war pain, trims buyback ","
                        
                        
                        Apple on Thursday trimmed its share buyback program by $10 billion, with CEO Tim Cook telling analysts that tariffs could add about $900 million in costs this quarter as the iPhone maker shifts its vast supply chain to minimise the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war.

Cook also said Apple's planned $500 billion in spending to expand its US footprint would involve both capital outlays and increased operational expenses as it builds out server and chip factories with its manufacturing partners. In addition, he outlined how Apple has started to build up a stockpile of products so that the majority of its devices sold in the US this quarter will not come from China.

Taken together, analysts said the moves showed one of the most profitable companies in the history of business battening its hatches as it moves into uncharted waters.

""We were expecting to see more buybacks. Knowing the company, this indicates that Tim Cook is hoarding cash for difficult times,"" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. ""While that's not exactly a problem in itself, it certainly suggests that the company is not as certain about its near-term future as it was in previous quarters.""

Apple shares were down 4.3% after the company released quarterly results.

So far, the trade war has not been a problem for Apple's sales, with Cook saying the company did not see consumers rushing to stock up on Apple items.

The Cupertino, California-based company said sales and profit for the fiscal second quarter ended March 29 were $95.36 billion and $1.65 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $94.68 billion and $1.63 per share, according to LSEG data. Sales of iPhones were $46.84 billion, compared with estimates of $46.17 billion, according to LSEG data.

For the current fiscal third quarter, Apple executives said the company expects low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth, which is in line with analyst expectations of 4.28% growth to $89.45 billion, according to LSEG data.

But Apple predicted a hit to gross margins, which it said will be 45.5% to 46.5% in its fiscal third quarter, which is below analyst estimates of 46.58%, according to LSEG data.

Cook said that for the quarter ending in June, ""assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our cost."".

He said the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. in the current quarter will come from India, and that most iPads, Macs and Apple Watches will come from Vietnam. Cook said that the vast majority of Apple products for markets outside the US will continue to come from China.

""We have a complex supply chain. There's always risk in the supply chain,"" he said. ""What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it.""

Cook also signalled that Apple's efforts to spend more in the US will come with real costs to Apple's balance sheet. He said the company already sources 19 billion chips from a dozen US states and will be expanding its own facilities.

""As we expand facilities in the different states - from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington - there will be (capital expenditures) involved in that,"" Cook said.

For Apple's second quarter, sales in its services business were $26.65 billion, compared with estimates of $26.69 billion, according to LSEG data. Apple said sales in its Greater China segment fell to $16 billion, better than analyst expectations of $15.9 billion, according to data from Visible Alpha.

In Apple's accessories and wearables segment, which includes products such as AirPods, revenue was $7.52 billion, compared with estimates of $7.85 billion, according to LSEG.

Sales of iPads and Macs were $6.40 billion and $7.95 billion, respectively, compared with analyst expectations of $6.07 billion and $7.92 billion. Cook said that entry-level iPads performed the best during the quarter.

Apple also said it will increase its cash dividend by 4% to 26 cents per share and that its board has authorized an additional $100 billion for its stock buyback program, down $10 billion from the same time last year.

 Garment workers full of hope as commission recommends rationing programme ,"
                        
                        
                        For Bangladesh‚Äôs garment workers, the beginning of the month is often the most financially challenging, as they struggle to make ends meet until wages are disbursed, typically between the 7th and 10th of every month.


As families dread the high food bills, relatives in their villages anxiously await the arrival of payday.


Recent discussions about introducing a ration system for garment workers have sparked hope for many like Masrufa Yasmin, who believes that receiving rations at the start of the month would help ease the burden of those difficult days.


‚ÄúIt would be great if we could get rations,‚Äù said Masrufa, who works as a helper at Grameen Fashions in Gazipur. ‚ÄúThen we won‚Äôt have to worry about food for the first few days of the month.‚Äù


The demand for providing rations to garment workers has gained momentum in recent years, as their calls for wage increases have gone unanswered. That demand has grown louder since inflation climbed into double digits last year.


Following the fall of the Awami League government in the July Uprising, Bangladesh is now undergoing a wave of reforms. As part of this transition, the interim government‚Äôs Labour Reform Commission has recommended a card-based ration system for workers in both industrial zones and rural areas in their final report, as part of broader social security measures.


However, several key questions remain unanswered: How much food will be allocated per person? What will be the annual cost of implementation? Where will the funding come from? And who will manage the system?


Due to the absence of adequate research, experts remain divided on the feasibility of such a scheme. But there is consensus on one point: as the workforce behind one of Bangladesh‚Äôs largest sources of foreign currency, garment workers deserve to be supported by the state.


Factory owners argue they lack the financial capacity to provide rations on their own, without the government‚Äôs help. However, the government has yet to make any decision on the matter.




WHY ARE RATIONS IMPORTANT


According to a 2016 study by the Asian Centre for Development, garment workers in Bangladesh spend 72 percent of their total income on food and rent.


In other words, from a monthly income of Tk 15,720, around Tk 11,318 is spent solely on these two essentials.


On average, 11 percent is sent to relatives in their home villages, with the remainder going towards healthcare, education, and other daily expenses.


Food inflation in Bangladesh has been on the rise in recent years. While general inflation hovers around 10 percent, food inflation exceeded 12 percent last year, making it the highest in South Asia.


The working class bears the brunt of these rising costs. According to economists, a rationing system could serve as an effective way to relieve this pressure.


Mostafizur Rahman, honorary fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), told bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúWorkers are not responsible for food inflation. It is the state's moral obligation to provide them with rations. If workers receive rations, their nutrition will improve, which in turn will boost their productivity.‚Äù


Speaking on the impact of rising food prices across different socio-economic groups, Mostafizur also emphasised the need for more research into how various classes experience inflation.


Of the four million workers employed in the garment sector, most come from low-income, rural families. By sending a portion of their earnings back home, these workers also play a vital role in alleviating poverty in rural areas.


The industry contributes 21 percent to Bangladesh‚Äôs GDP, which is the highest in South Asia. Half of this comes from the manufacturing sector, with ready-made garments making up 80 percent of that share.


Therefore, garment workers deserve monthly rations, even if it is for the sake of their significant contributions to the national economy, said Binayak Sen, Director General of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS).


Rations would also serve as a ‚Äúgreat help‚Äù during periods when factories shut down, said Zakir Sardar, a machine operator at Z Apparels in Savar.


‚ÄúI was unemployed for three months,‚Äù he told bdnews24.com. ‚ÄúI took on any daily wage work I could find until I found a new job on the 26th. If I had access to rations during that time, it would have been easier.‚Äù


Nazmun Nahar, a sewing operator at BFSL in Nabi Nagar, and her husband, both work in garment factories. Their eldest daughter is a university student, and they see her education as equally important as daily living expenses.


‚ÄúI have to keep track of every single penny, otherwise I can‚Äôt cover my daughter‚Äôs education costs,‚Äù Nazmun said.


‚ÄúEven if I save a single taka through rations, it would be really helpful.‚Äù


Masrufa‚Äôs husband, Mahfuzul Alam, has worked in the garment industry for over a decade. He hopes to set aside some savings amid discussions of a potential rationing system.


A worker at Doreen Washing Plant, Mahfuz keeps his children in the village with his mother to reduce living costs, while he and his wife support their family of five from the city.


‚ÄúWhatever I can save through rations, I‚Äôll put in the bank,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven if I save just Tk 1,000, at least I‚Äôll have something for the future.‚Äù




HOW MUCH WILL IT COST? WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM?


The estimated annual cost of the rationing system has not been published yet.


However, Binayak Sen shared his observations on the matter at a seminar, saying that if the government can provide rations until the inflation rate comes down to around 5 to 6 percent, the country‚Äôs production system will remain stable.


‚ÄúProviding a ration subsidy of at least Tk 1,000 per worker per month would require Tk 4 billion monthly, or Tk 50 billion annually. The government could allocate this amount through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB),‚Äù he said.


This means the government would need to allocate Tk 50 billion in the national budget annually in the initial phase to sustain a rationing programme.


However, neither the government nor labour organisations have proposed any funding sources for this expenditure.


Zahid Hossain, former lead economist at the World Bank‚Äôs Dhaka office, believes that to finance such a programme, the government must either increase its revenue or divert funds from other subsidy areas.


Speaking to bdnews24.com, he said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs limited scope in the current budget to expand subsidies. As per advice from the IMF and other groups, the government is trying to reduce existing subsidies. So whether the support comes in the form of food or cash, it must be given by cutting back elsewhere.‚Äù


One of the biggest challenges of a rationing programme, whether ration or cash-based, lies in its administration, ensuring that the benefits reach the recipients. To ensure this, an organisation would need to oversee the disbursement of funds at the grassroots level.


Abul Kalam Azad, joint general secretary of the Bangladesh Trade Union Centre (TUC), suggested that rations could be distributed through the state-owned TCB in coordination with factory owners and workers‚Äô representatives.


However, Zahid expressed doubts about the TCB‚Äôs capacity to manage such a large-scale operation in a labour-intensive industry, as it is a massive logistical task, ranging from procurement to storage to deliveries at factory gates.


Moreover, there has been no research on how much additional administrative costs would be required to deliver Tk 50 billion in aid.


‚ÄúThe proposal sounds good in theory. But where will the money come from? Whether it‚Äôs cash or food, what will be its actual economic impact? These questions need to be researched before the plan can be considered,‚Äù Zahid added.


On the other hand, Mostafizur argued that the workers‚Äô rations should come from the same source as the salaries, allowances, and pensions for civil servants.




WHAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FACTORY OWNERS ARE SAYING


If the government moves forward with the Labour Reform Commission‚Äôs recommendation by introducing a rationing system for garment workers, how might factory owners participate in the scheme?


According to Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), factory owners in the readymade garment sector cannot afford such a responsibility.


‚ÄúThe government would need to take on the majority of the cost. We, as employers, can participate, but this would need to be discussed and agreed upon.‚Äù


Syed Nazrul Islam, managing director of Well Designers, echoed similar sentiments.


‚ÄúPost-COVID, we no longer have the same capacity. Some may be able to contribute, but others cannot. It would be best if the government could take on the full responsibility. After all, factory owners already deposit a portion of their profits each year into the government‚Äôs Workers‚Äô Welfare Fund,‚Äù he said.


Kamran T Rahman, a member of the Labour Reform Commission and president of the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), said that the commission recommended implementing the programme after consulting everyone, including employers, workers, and trade union leaders.


‚ÄúMost of them are in favour of the rationing system. The government can now assess the proposal. Implementation will come later.‚Äù


Kamran added that once the government decides, there can be further discussion on funding and logistics.


When approached for comment, AHM Shafiquzzaman, secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, told bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúThe Labour Reform Commission has made several recommendations for the welfare of workers, including the introduction of a rationing system. After May Day, we will sit with the relevant ministries, and implement the ones that can be done.‚Äù

On Apr 2, Trump announced a sweeping tariff hike, which included a 37 percent supplementary duty on Bangladeshi exports.

The average tariff on Bangladeshi goods rose from 15 percent to 52 percent following the move.

After a wave of global backlash, Washington announced on Apr 9 that the new tariff regime would be suspended for three months.

Just days earlier, on Apr 7, Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus had written to Trump, urging him to reconsider the decision.

Dhaka now hopes to secure a longer grace period, with Salehuddin confirming that discussions with US agencies and American businesses are ongoing.

The advisor also reassured businesses that the upcoming budget would be ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù in light of IMF pressure and the US tariff challenges.

‚ÄúThe goal is to prepare a practical budget‚Äîone that ensures efficient use of resources,‚Äù he said.

He hinted at reforms to simplify business licence renewals and remove ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù legal barriers, saying businesses would soon see changes.

Salehuddin, however, was firm in saying tax exemptions would not be expanded.

The advisor said: ‚ÄúOne thing you must keep in mind is that the era of tax exemptions is over. We‚Äôre under a lot of pressure.

‚ÄúRevenue collection must increase to keep the government running and to provide you with incentives‚Äîwe need to earn that money first.‚Äù

‚ÄúPaying taxes should not be seen purely as an expense. It supports health, education, and social services‚Äîyour contributions benefit society as a whole,‚Äù he added.

 ACI Qurbani Express launches to provide ‚Äòhassle-free cattle purchases‚Äô ,"
                        
                        
                        Bangladeshi conglomerate ACI is launching ACI Qurbani Express ahead of Eid-ul-Adha to provide customers with an ‚Äúinnovative and ethical approach to sacrificial cattle procurement‚Äù in Dhaka city.

Through collaboration with retail arm Shwapno, the service aims to simplify the Qurbani process while ensuring Shari‚Äôah compliance, customer convenience, and fair opportunities for marginal farmers, ACI says in a report.

‚ÄúFor decades, traditional cattle markets have been associated with stress, uncertainty in pricing, concerns over animal health, and a lack of transparency. ACI Qurbani Express addresses these challenges by creating a streamlined and secure system that meets the modern-day needs of both urban and rural communities,‚Äù ACI said in a press release.

Customers can now book sacrificial animals through Shwapno through direct farmer-to-customer transactions that eliminate middlemen.

ACI says this will not only strengthen the rural economy, but also support small-scale livestock owners.

Buyers can also purchase animals in increments, with animals directly delivered to their doorsteps two days before Eid.

‚ÄúA major highlight of this initiative is its focus on ethical and natural cattle rearing. All animals are raised by marginal farmers without the use of harmful steroids or artificial growth enhancers. Their health is monitored by certified veterinarians, with regular vaccinations, deworming, and medical check-ups. Customers receive monthly health updates and can even request physical visits to see their animals, ensuring transparency and trust,‚Äù ACI says.

The service will also provide live weight pricing to give customers accurate prices based on weight at time of delivery while also maintaining a unique identification code for tracking.

‚ÄúThe entire process is supervised by its Shari‚Äôah Supervisory Board, ensuring complete compliance with Islamic principles‚Äîfrom the ownership transfer to handling unforeseen circumstances like animal illness or death. The platform also encourages early booking to allow buyers to form a spiritual connection with their animal, in line with the essence of the Qurbani ritual,‚Äù ACI says.

ACI Qurbani Express is available from the website and through a mobile app.

 Dhaka stocks extend losses amid volatile trading ,"
                        
                        
                        The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), the country‚Äôs premier bourse, has extended losses into a second day amid market volatility.
The benchmark index, DSEX, shed 17 points to close at 4,935 points as trade turnover plunged to Tk 2.91 billion on Tuesday. This was the second time in four months that the volume of trade fell below Tk 3-billion mark.
Share prices in the clothing, medicine and chemicals, and engineering sectors rose nonetheless.
After a bearish spell of almost two weeks, the DSEX gained 22.85 points to close at 4,995.46 on Sunday before dipping again on Monday, losing 42 points.
On Tuesday, trading opened strongly in the morning, with the DSEX gaining nine points within the first half-hour. The momentum then began to tail off as the index dropped to 4,935 points around 11am.
A brief recovery followed as selling pressure eased and the index regained the lost ground by 12:30pm.
A positive buying trend then sent prices into correction and the index could not recover at the close, ultimately ending at 3,935 points.
On Sunday, despite a modest rise, overall trading volume had fallen as the turnover dropped to Tk 3.39 billion from Tk 3.67 billion on Thursday.
On Monday, the capital market transactions reached Tk 4.53 billion.
The task force on capital market reforms presented its final recommendations for amending the margin lending policy at a press conference that day.
It proposed tighter restrictions on margin loans. The next day, investor sentiment weakened, culminating in a big drop in the key index and transactions.
According to DSE data, the clothing, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and engineering sectors were the major contributors to Tuesday‚Äôs trade volume.
The banking, food and allied, and power and energy sectors also featured prominently.
Of the 397 listed companies and funds, share prices of 136 rose, 211 fell while 50 remained unchanged.
Based on closing prices, Energy Pack, Prime Finance First Mutual Fund and United Finance topped the list of gainers, while Power Grid Bangladesh, ICB Islamic Bank, and Pragati Life Insurance were the biggest losers.

" India queries Apple, Xiaomi in e-commerce probe of Amazon, Flipkart, sources say ","
                        
                        
                        India's financial crime agency has privately sought sales data and other documents from smartphone players including Apple and Xiaomi as part of an investigation into Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The agency's queries come in the backdrop of India and the United States nearing a trade deal. The protectionist e-commerce regulations in India have been part of those discussions, according to one Indian official, as US authorities have long called for opening up the sector.

India's Enforcement Directorate agency, which probes economic crimes, has been investigating Amazon and Flipkart for years for allegedly breaching laws by stocking and exerting control over goods they list online. Indian laws prohibit foreign e-commerce companies from doing so as the platforms can only operate a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers.

India's small traders say such clandestine practices, along with steep online discounts, have disrupted businesses at mobile phone stores, but Amazon and Flipkart have maintained they comply with all Indian laws.

The directorate wrote in recent weeks to smartphone companies, including Apple and Xiaomi, to get data related to their online sales, according to three industry sources and one senior Indian government official, who all declined to be named as the investigation process is confidential.

One of the industry sources said the Enforcement Directorate was looking at dealings between smartphone companies Amazon and Flipkart, and had also sought any financial contracts signed by the phone makers for online sales.

Apple received the agency's directive in March, said one of the sources.

Apple, Amazon and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Enforcement Directorate also did not respond, while Xiaomi declined to comment.

India's e-retail market is set to exceed $160 billion by 2028, up from $57-60 billion in 2023, consultancy firm Bain estimates.

The government official said the smartphone companies had been approached by the directorate only to seek information and it was unlikely they would be accused in the case, although ""the investigation is going.""

""Eventually if there's wrongdoing, there will be monetary penalties (on e-commerce companies),"" said the official.

Last year, a separate Indian antitrust investigation concluded Amazon and Flipkart breached antitrust laws by giving preference to select sellers on their platforms, and also colluding with Samsung, Xiaomi and other smartphone companies to exclusively launch products online.

The companies have not commented on the report and the antitrust case is still ongoing.

Counterpoint Research data shows that Samsung and Xiaomi together held an almost 33 percent share of the Indian market in 2024, with Apple at 7 percent. Around 40 percent of phone sales in India are online.

A Reuters investigation in 2021, based on internal Amazon papers, showed the company exerted significant control over the inventory of some of the biggest sellers. The company denied wrongdoing.

" China's Huawei develops new AI chip, seeking to match Nvidia, WSJ reports ","
                        
                        
                        China's Huawei Technologies is preparing to test its newest and most powerful artificial-intelligence processor, hoping to replace some higher-end products of US chip giant Nvidia, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The Chinese company hopes that the latest iteration of its Ascend AI processors will be more powerful than Nvidia's H100, and is slated to receive the first batch of samples of the processor as early as late May, the report added.
Reuters reported on Monday that Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month.
Huawei and its Chinese peers have struggled for years to match Nvidia in building top-end chips that could compete with the US firm's products for training models, a process where data is fed to algorithms to help them learn to make accurate decisions.

Seeking to limit China's technological development, particularly advances for its military, Washington has cut China off from Nvidia's most advanced AI products, including its flagship B200 chip.
The H100 chip, for example, was banned from sale in China in 2022 by US authorities before it was even launched.
Nvidia declined to comment while Huawei did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

 Dhaka stocks snap 2-week losing streak ,"
                        
                        
                        The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) has rebounded after more than two weeks of continuous losses.

The bourse's benchmark index, DSEX, rose by 22.85 points to close at 4,995.46 on Sunday, compared to 4,972.59 points the previous trading day.

The index had fallen sharply on Thursday to end the week below the 5,000-point mark for the first time in five and a half months. Sunday's recovery brought the market close to that threshold again.

The DSEX last recorded a gain on Apr 10, when it closed at 5,205 points, with a total turnover of Tk 5.40 billion.

Despite Sunday's modest rise, overall trading volume fell. Turnover dropped to Tk 3.39 billion from Tk 3.67 billion the day before.

Analysis of trading data showed that gains in the pharmaceuticals and chemicals, engineering, and banking sectors drove the market's rebound. The strong performance of these key sectors helped lift the index.

As in recent sessions, trading started on a negative note on Sunday morning and continued to decline until around 12:30pm, with the index losing another 50 points.

However, buying pressure later in the day helped the market recover, and the index finished the session on a stronger footing.

The DSE began to show signs of recovery after the fall of the Awami League government on Aug 5, 2024, following mass protests led by students. Investors, too, had started regaining some of their lost confidence.

However, the upward momentum did not last. Despite an increase in trading volume, the index displayed a mixed trend, and by late September, the market became volatile again.

Frequent price swings and political uncertainty at the regulatory body pushed many investors to the sidelines.

After a meeting between the Finance Advisor Salehuddin Ahmed and the market regulator, the index began a slow recovery, with turnover gradually rising. Yet, the momentum failed to hold.

The index, which had crossed the 6,000-point mark in August, fell back to around 5,500 by late September.

During Ramadan, the market remained volatile, and by the end of the month, the index dropped further to around 5,200 points.

Investors had hoped for a post-Eid turnaround. But DSE data shows that after the Eid-ul-Fitr holiday, the index continued falling for over 15 consecutive days.

By the end of Sunday's session, most companies posted gains. According to DSE data, out of 397 companies that traded, 235 made gains, 99 declined, and 63 remained unchanged.

Banks led the day's turnover, followed by pharmaceuticals and chemicals, with the power and energy sector in third place.

Based on closing prices, Bashundhara Paper Mills, S Alam Cold Rolled Steels, and Avance Textiles topped the list of gainers, while Standard Ceramic, DESCO, and Mir Akhter were the biggest losers.

                        Apple aims to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026, and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China, its main manufacturing base, a source told Reuters.

 

The US tech giant is holding urgent talks with contract manufacturers Foxconn and Tata to achieve that goal, the person, who declined to be named as the planning process is confidential, said on Friday.

 

Apple and Foxconn did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Tata declined to comment.

 

Apple sells over 60 million iPhones in the US annually with roughly 80% of them made in China currently.

 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub, but higher duties on importing mobile phone parts compared to many other countries means it is still expensive for companies to produce in India.

 

For iPhones, manufacturing costs in India are 5-8% higher than in China, with the difference rising to as much as 10% in some cases, the source said.

 

Apple has already stepped up production in India to beat US President Donald Trump's tariffs, shipping some 600 tons of iPhones worth $2 billion to the United States in March. The shipments from India marked a record for both its contractors Tata and Foxconn, with the latter alone accounting for smartphones worth $1.3 billion, Reuters reported last week.

 

In April, the US administration imposed 26% duties on imports from India, much lower than the more than 100% China was facing at the time. Washington has since paused most duties for three months, except for China.

 

Trump's administration has since signalled openness to de-escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies that has raised fears of recession.

 

The Financial Times first reported about Apple's plan on Friday.

 

As Apple diversifies its manufacturing beyond China, it has positioned India for a critical role. Foxconn and Tata, its two main suppliers there, have three factories in all, with two more being built.

 Conflicting US-China talks statements add to global trade confusion ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump asserted in an interview published on Friday that tariff negotiations were under way with China, but Beijing denied any talks were taking place, the latest in a series of conflicting signals over what progress was being made to de-escalate a trade war threatening to sap global growth.

 

Trump told TIME magazine that talks were taking place and that Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him, an assertion he repeated to reporters as he was leaving the White House on Friday morning for Rome to attend the funeral of Pope Francis.

 

""China and the US are NOT having any consultation or negotiation on #tariffs,"" China shot back in a foreign ministry statement posted by the Chinese Embassy in the US ""The US should stop creating confusion.""

 

Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One later on Friday, said it would be a win if China would open up its markets for US products and that tariffs could make that happen.

 

""Free up China. You know, let us go in and work China,"" he said. ""That would be great. That would be a big win, but I'm not even sure I'm going to ask for it because they don't want it open.""



On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing abides by international rules on US-imposed tariffs and would seek solidarity with other countries.

 

""Certain countries adhere to their own priorities, engage in bullying pressure and coercive transactions, and provoke trade wars for no reason, exposing their extreme egoism,"" Wang said on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Kazakhstan, according to a statement from China's foreign ministry.

 

The back-and-forth adds to the substantial uncertainty surrounding Trump's erratic tariff policy, not just around China, but also as it pertains to the dozens of countries scrambling to strike their own deals to ease the burden of the hefty import taxes he has unleashed since returning to the White House in January.

 

His team of negotiators was conducting what amounted to a lightning round of trade talks with foreign officials who had swarmed Washington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group.

 

But while Trump officials including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touted indications of swift progress, many of their counterparts were more circumspect. Finance chiefs at the IMF were heading home with renewed urgency to diminish the risks presented by the tariffs.

 

""I'm walking away from these meetings with a clear sense of everything that is at stake and the risks that are there for jobs, for growth, for living standards all over the world,"" Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told Reuters.

 

""The meetings here... reminded me of why we need to leave no stone unturned in the next few weeks and months to see how we can reduce that uncertainty.""

 

DE-ESCALATION

 

While clarity on whether deals are actually being struck to avoid the imposition of even steeper tariffs in early July, there were signs of some de-escalation.

 

China exempted some US imports from its steep tariffs as business groups said Beijing has allowed some US-made pharmaceuticals to enter the country without paying the 125% duties that Beijing imposed earlier this month in response to Trump's 145% tariffs on Chinese imports.

 

Also, a list of 131 product categories said to be under consideration for exemptions was circulating among some businesses and trade groups. Reuters could not verify the list, which includes vaccines, chemicals and jet engines, and China has not yet communicated publicly on the issue.

 

Trump's administration has also in recent days signaled it is looking to defuse the tension with China, with Bessent saying both sides see the current state of play as untenable.

 

Trump told reporters at the White House that he was very close to a deal with Japan. That is seen by analysts as a ""test case"" for other bilateral trade agreements, though talks could be difficult. Some expect Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump to announce a pact when they meet at the summit of the Group of Seven nations in Canada in June.



Trump also told TIME that he had made ""200 deals"" that would be completed within three to four weeks, though he declined to provide specifics. He said he would consider it a ""total victory"" if tariffs were still 20% to 50% a year from now.

 

The president has argued that his thicket of trade barriers will revive US manufacturing industries that have been hollowed out by global competition.

 

Economists, however, broadly warn that they would lead to higher prices for US consumers and increase the risk of recession.

 

US stocks were on track for a weekly gain, though they are down roughly 10% since Trump returned to office in January, lagging indexes in other countries, while the dollar has fallen at an unprecedented rate.

 

European and Asian stocks headed for a second straight week of gains on Friday and the dollar eyed its first weekly rise in more than a month, as investors took comfort from signs the US and China were prepared to pull back from their trade war. Wall Street's main indexes rose slightly as investors struggled for clarity on the US-China trade front.

 

In addition to the country-specific tariffs, Trump has also imposed a blanket 10% tariff on all other US imports and higher duties on steel, aluminum and autos.

 

He has also floated additional industry-specific levies on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. That could cause drug prices in the US to rise by up to 12.9%, according to an industry estimate.

 

Trump's tariffs dominated discussions at the IMF meetings this week, where finance ministers angled for one-on-one meetings with the US treasury secretary.

 

Bessent characterized initial talks with South Korea as ""very successful"" on Thursday, which Seoul called a ""good start."" Further discussions are scheduled for next week.

 

Switzerland said it was satisfied with its initial meeting with Bessent. The US trade office said it is ""constantly engaged"" with Japan and other countries, but said Trump would ultimately decide whether they would proceed.

 

There was little sign of tangible progress with other countries, despite the urging of IMF head Kristalina Georgieva, who warned this week they could cause a severe slowdown in global growth.

 Chicken prices drop due to 'hot weather' as vegetables rise ,"
                        
                        
                        Having enjoyed a period of cost-effective shopping, consumers are now dealing with soaring vegetable prices while chicken offers some comfort with its reduced cost.
Traders say many poultry farmers are selling off their stock fearing that the intense heat may lead to the death of chickens, leading to the price dip.
The same weather conditions have also been blamed for the surge in vegetable prices, as sellers cite low rainfall causing a slowdown in production.
Despite fluctuations in chicken and vegetable prices, the cost of onions and soyabean oil has remained steady this week‚Äîalthough both saw hikes after Eid.
A visit to Dhaha‚Äôs Mohakhali, Saattola and Niketan kitchen markets on Friday, a public holiday, revealed the contrasting trend.
Most vegetables on sale were priced above Tk 60 per kg, with several items crossing Tk 100.
Only a handful were available at comparatively lower rates.
In the summer vegetable category, bitter gourd, pointed gourd, sponge gourd, aubergine and ridge gourd were selling for Tk 70 to 80 per kg. Okra was slightly lower at Tk 60.
A few seasonal vegetables were being sold for well over Tk 100.
Yardlong beans cost between Tk 100 to 110, teasel gourd Tk 110 to 120, taro stolon Tk 80 to 100, and Moringa drumsticks Tk 130 to 140 per kg.
Jasim Uddin, a vendor at Niketan kitchen market, told bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúSupply of summer vegetables is low. This year‚Äôs poor rainfall has affected production.


‚ÄúPrices are already high in the wholesale markets, so we have to sell at higher rates.‚Äù
Some winter vegetables were still on offer but at elevated prices compared with the season.
Flat beans were priced at Tk 60 to 80 per kg, radish at Tk 60, turnip at Tk 60, while cauliflower varied by size from Tk 40 to 60 each.
Bottle gourd sold for Tk 50 to 100 and ash gourd Tk 50 to 60.
Only a few items could be found under Tk 60. Green bananas were Tk 40 per four-piece bunch, papaya Tk 50 per kg, and sweet pumpkin Tk 40 to 50.
Lemon prices, which remained high after Eid, have dropped to Tk 10 to 20 per four-piece pack.
Coriander leaves sold for Tk 120 to 140, while capsicum was priced between Tk 150 to 180 per kg.
Raw mangoes were also being sold across the markets. Many use them to add flavour to dishes with small fish and lentils. They were available at Tk 50 to 60 per kg.
Green chilli remained stable over the week, selling for Tk 60 to 80 per kg. Among the lingering winter items, tomatoes were priced relatively lower at Tk 40 to 50 per kg.
Carrots cost Tk 50, while cucumbers were priced at Tk 70‚Äì80.
Gopal Chandra Shil, a shopper at Saattola market, said: ‚ÄúI work at a salon. These prices are becoming hard to handle.


‚ÄúThe last couple of months were manageable, but now everything is expensive again.‚Äù
Md Shahjalal, a private sector employee shopping at the same market, expressed similar frustration. ‚ÄúPrices went up after Eid. If they could be controlled earlier, why not now? Otherwise, it‚Äôs going to stretch our wallets,‚Äù he said.
Despite the price hikes in vegetables, leafy greens were being sold at regular rates. Red amaranth was Tk 15 to 20 per bunch, bottle gourd leaves Tk 40, spinach Tk 15, water spinach Tk 10, Malabar spinach Tk 40 to 50, Indian spinach Tk 10, and jute leaves Tk 30 per bunch.

Within a week, the price of all types of chicken has decreased in the market.
Rajib Hossain, a seller at Rajib-Mukta Poultry Shop in the Sattola market, confirmed the price changes to bdnews24.com.
According to his details, the price of Sonali chicken has dropped by Tk 20 per kg compared to last week, now selling for Tk 260, while the Sonali Hybrid breed is being sold for Tk 240 per kg.
Red Layer chicken is available at Tk 270 per kg and White Layer chicken is priced between Tk 250 and Tk 260.
Broiler chicken has also seen a decline, with prices dropping by Tk 10 per kg, ranging from Tk 170 to Tk 180, while Deshi (local) chicken is now priced between Tk 630 and Tk 680 per kg, down by Tk 40 to Tk 50.
When asked about the price drop, Rajib said: ""The intense heat over the past few days has created concerns about chickens dying, especially broilers. As a result, the prices have come down slightly.""
 SPICE PRICES REMAIN UNCHANGED
Most spice products in the market are being sold at their previous prices. The onion market, which spiked unexpectedly last week, has also stabilised at its earlier price.
Al Amin, a vendor at the Mohakhali Kitchen market, confirmed this to bdnews24.com.
According to him, potatoes from Bogura are being sold for Tk 20 to Tk 25 per kg.
Domestic hybrid onions remain priced at Tk 60 per kg while Indian onions are being sold at Tk 50 per kg.
In addition, ginger is being sold for Tk 140 to Tk 280 per kg, domestic garlic for Tk 90 to Tk 100, Indian garlic for Tk 220 to Tk 230, locally produced Mosur Dal (red lentils) at Tk 140, hybrid (large grain) lentils at Tk 110, Mung dal at Tk 180, and chickpeas at Tk 100 to Tk 110 per kg.
The vendor said, ‚ÄúWe heard news of raids in the onion market, with concerns that prices might rise further, particularly in wholesale markets in Faridpur and other areas. The prices, however, have now stabilised.
‚ÄúIn addition, the prices of other spice products have not fluctuated much, and the supply of bottled soyabean oil has returned to normal after the price hike,‚Äù he added.

 Rancon Auto Industries Ltd launches Mitsubishi Xpander assembly in Bangladesh‚Äôs growing auto sector ,"
                        
                        
                        RANCON Auto Industries Limited (RAIL), an automotive assembly and manufacturing centre, is set for a full-scale rollout of the assembly of the Mitsubishi Xpander in June.

RAIL invited journalists for a detailed tour of the facility as company representatives outlined their vision to position Bangladesh as a future player in the regional automotive sector.

The move signals Bangladesh‚Äôs move towards self-reliant, standards-driven automotive manufacturing and marks the beginning of a new phase in domestic vehicle assembly and paintwork, according to a media statement.

RANCON officials have said that trial production is under way for two models: the Mitsubishi Xpander and the Proton X70.

Full-scale commercial rollout of both is expected to begin in June.

The Proton X70 is a five-seater, while the Mitsubishi Xpander is a seven-seater multipurpose vehicle (MPV), designed for both passengers and cargo.

The statement added that the 1,500cc Xpander is expected to deliver a fuel efficiency of 8 to 9 km/liter in urban conditions. All vehicles will come with a five-year warranty. Pricing details are yet to be announced.

‚ÄúWe now have the capacity to manufacture vehicles that meet Japanese standards,‚Äù said Mohammad Fahim Hossain, head of marketing for Rancon Automotive Division‚Äì1.

‚ÄúOur production facility has been approved by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation for global-standard construction,‚Äù he added.



BUILDING A DOMESTIC INDUSTRY

Located on 23 hectares of land in Kashimpur, Gazipur, the Rancon Industrial Park includes three manufacturing units: RANCON Motorbike, RANCON Electronics, and RANCON Auto Industries with a combined workforce exceeding 800 people, the statement said.

The RAIL, established in 2017, houses units for painting, assembly, quality control, and warehousing, while technicians trained in Vietnam and Japan oversee operations using tools such as torque wrenches, pneumatic systems, and overhead cranes, it added.

RANCON Motorbike, established in 2014, assembles motorcycles of Suzuki. RANCON Electronics, launched in 2016, produces televisions and refrigerators from Toshiba, LG, and Samsung.



WORKFORCE AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT

With 250 professionals currently employed, many of whom hold certifications from international automotive partners, RAIL trains them and their daily work contributes to the development of skills in emissions testing, diagnostics, and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) calibration, the statement said.

It added that for workers transitioning from traditional manufacturing sectors, RAIL offers new career pathways and training opportunities. In a country where garment exports dominate, automotive assembly introduces more technical roles and potential for industry diversification.

COSTS, POLICY AND MARKET ENTRY

Company officials estimate that the locally assembled Xpander will be priced about 20 percent lower than the imported version, depending on tax regulations, according to the statement.

Present import duties exceed 120 percent. A revised Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) could reduce these rates, encouraging further local investment, it added.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just focused on one model or brand,‚Äù said Md Badiuzzaman, Executive Director of RAIL. ‚ÄúBy 2026, we aim to assemble four types of passenger cars and two types of commercial vehicles.‚Äù



TESTING AND QUALITY CONTROL

The facility includes a 2.5-kilometer test track with 16 driving conditions. Each vehicle undergoes tests for braking, emissions, alignment, and onboard diagnostics before market release.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt compromise on safety or standards,‚Äù said Fahim Hossain. ‚ÄúWe want every vehicle that leaves here to be road-ready and reliable.‚Äù

RANCON aims to release 2,000 Mitsubishi Xpanders, 400 Proton X70s, 360 Mercedes buses, and 600 JAC trucks over the next 18 months, according to the officials.

While modest by global standards, these figures represent early progress in building domestic manufacturing capacity.

The broader goal is not just to assemble vehicles, but to contribute to skill development, infrastructure growth, and the diversification of Bangladesh‚Äôs industrial economy, the statement said.

" Workers could save 122 hours a year by adopting AI in admin tasks, says Google ","
                        
                        
                        Britain could gain 400 billion pounds ($533 billion) from AI-driven growth if it trained its workforce, Google said, after a pilot scheme in the UK showed workers could save more than 120 hours a year by using AI in administrative tasks.

Simple steps such as giving workers permission to use AI and a few hours of training to get them started could help double the adoption of the new technology, and in turn boost economic growth, Google said in a report on its pilot scheme, published on Friday.

The US tech giant, which developed the Gemini AI chatbot, said that according to analysis by Public First, its partner in the scheme, two thirds of workers - particularly older women from lower socio-economic backgrounds - had never used generative AI at work.

Debbie Weinstein, Google's Europe, Middle East and Africa president, said the AI Works pilots - conducted in a small business network, educational trusts and a union - showed workers could save on average 122 hours a year by using AI in administrative tasks.

But one barrier stopping some from dipping a toe into the water was a concern that using AI in their job was not legitimate nor fair.

""People wanted 'permission to prompt'"", Weinstein said in an interview. ""'Is it okay for me to be doing this?' And so giving them that reassurance was really important.""

Once they started, a few hours of AI training to build their confidence resulted in them using the technology twice as much, she said, and they were still using it several months later.

These simple interventions helped to narrow the AI adoption gap amongst the participants in the pilot studies, Google said in its AI Works report.

Before training, for example, only 17% of women aged above 55 in its cohorts used AI weekly and only 9% daily.

Three months later, 56% were using it weekly and 29% had made it a daily habit.

 Two-day Meet Bangladesh Exposition begins in Dhaka ,"
                        
                        
                        The ‚ÄúMeet Bangladesh Exposition‚Äù, a two-day international exhibition on export potential organised by the EC4J Project (Export Competitiveness for Jobs) under the commerce ministry, has begun in Dhaka.

The curtain of the exhibition rose with the participation of international sourcing agents and buyers at the capital‚Äôs International Convention City Bashundhara on Thursday morning.

Commerce Advisor Sheikh Bashir Uddin inaugurated the fair.

He said, ""We all know that our exports depend a lot on a single product. And we should diversify the exports. We need to utilise our growing population for sustainable economic growth by eliminating corruption and increasing transparency.""

""Our BIDA (Bangladesh Investment Development Authority) recently organised a successful international conference to increase investment in Bangladesh. We talked about our capabilities and opportunities there.

""I pay my sincere respect to the entrepreneurs who have brought Bangladesh to this stage despite many obstacles and who have brought their products to showcase here. I invite foreign investors to take advantage of the investment opportunities in Bangladesh.""

He continued, ""As you know, we recently had an issue with our transhipment, and you will be delighted to know that we overcame the crisis very smoothly. Many thought that this would hurt our exports, but nothing like that happened. Rather our export costs will drop further.

""I assure maximum support from the ministry to you (investors). Inform us about your problems. We will help you and work together. I will always be at your service.""

Later, he inaugurated the exhibition by cutting a ribbon. He visited stalls and interacted with the participants afterwards.



The exhibition aims to showcase Bangladesh's potential export sectors such as leather, footwear, MPPE, plastics and light engineering products.

According to the organisers, more than 120 companies from these sectors are exhibiting their products at the exhibition.

Under one roof, more than 25 international sourcing agents and buyers from more than nine countries such as Singapore, Libya, Colombia, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, India, Bhutan, Maldives and Malaysia, more than 1,000 local buyers, and more than 120 Bangladeshi manufacturing companies are getting the opportunity to connect B2B (business-to-business) and network with each other.

Bangladeshi manufacturers are getting the opportunity to directly engage with international buyers, sourcing agents, investors and sectoral leaders to expand their business in the fair.

At the end of the exhibition, international sourcing agents and buyers will visit a number of industrial plants manufacturing Bangladeshi products. The organisers expect that this will help to promote Bangladesh's export sector and increase foreign investment in the country.

In addition, the exposition will also feature sector-based breakout sessions, workshops and talks attended by industry experts and business leaders.

The EC4J Project also aims to directly contribute to achieving the Bangladesh government's policy goal of export diversification beyond the ready-made garment (RMG) sector, the organisers said.

At the same time, increasing the competitiveness of the relevant sectors and ensuring economic diversification will ensure the country's export earnings and stability and create employment opportunities within the country.

The organisers also expressed hope that the project initiatives would help deal with the economic adversities of the future.

The two-day exhibition will continue until Friday. It is open to the public from 10am to 7pm.

 Relief rally stutters as markets take stock of Trump's U-turns ,"
                        
                        
                        Stocks drifted on Thursday and a rebound in the dollar lost traction as investors tried to sift through the noise from the Trump administration and its fickle stance on tariffs and the Federal Reserve's leadership.

Just this week, US President Donald Trump has rained attacks on Fed head Jerome Powell, then retracted calls for the chair's resignation, and left investors none the wiser on the ultimate state of tariffs on China despite many headlines around it.

The Trump administration would look at lowering tariffs on imported Chinese goods pending talks with Beijing, a source told Reuters on Wednesday, after a Wall Street Journal report that the White House is considering cutting its tariffs on Chinese imports.

But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later said that such a move would not come unilaterally, echoing comments from White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.

""I don't think you can ever get used to the sorts of haphazard and flip-flopping that we've seen. It's extreme,"" said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. ""I think that's Trump - he wants to try and find the right levers to pull, and I don't think he's scared of trying something, and I don't think he's scared of walking it back if it doesn't work.""

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.17%, bucking the trend on Wall Street after stocks advanced on Wednesday on hopes for a de-escalation of Sino-US trade tensions.

US futures steadied with the Nasdaq NQc1 and S&P 500 futures ESc1 up about 0.2% each. EUROSTOXX 50 futures STXEc1 edged 0.16% higher.

Japan's Nikkei .N225 gained 0.86%.

The Trump administration told Japan's trade delegation that it could not give Japan special treatment regarding its tariff measures, in response to Tokyo's strong demand for a review during the ministerial negotiations this month, NHK reported on Thursday.

""Short-term volatility is quite extreme right now... this high volatility is going to sustain, you have elevated volatility going forward, because the underlying foundational rules of the game are changing... the economic world order is changing,"" said Salman Ahmed, global head of macro and strategic asset allocation at Fidelity International.

""I think what is clear is that we are past peak globalisation, all that kind of free flow of trade and capital is not going to be the steady state,"" said Ahmed, speaking on the sidelines of the IMAS Investment Conference and Masterclass 2025 in Singapore.

The dollar lost some ground on Thursday, after a rebound this week on relief over Trump's U-turn on axing Powell, as investor confidence in US assets stayed fragile.

Against the yen JPY=EBS, the dollar fell 0.15% to 143.24. The euro EUR=EBS was up 0.15% to $1.1331, while the Swiss franc CHF=EBS rose about 0.2% to 0.8294 per dollar.

Longer-dated Treasuries steadied as Trump's reversal on Powell seemed to ease the threat to US monetary and fiscal credibility, with the 30-year yield US30YT=RR little changed at 4.3675%. US/

The benchmark 10-year yield US10YT=RR was down about 2 basis points to 4.3675%.

 Who‚Äôs pocketing the profit while onion farmers wait for fair prices? ,"
                        
                        
                        Every year during Ramadan, onion prices tend to fluctuate, but this time there was an exception.

Consumers remained at ease with prices throughout that month; however, the situation changed post-Ramadan, with prices rising.

This week, onion prices have increased by Tk 10 to Tk 20 per kg. While prices soar, many farmers are claiming losses.



This raises the question‚Äîwho's pocketing the real profits?

On Sunday, at Karwan Bazar and Mohakhali kitchen markets in Dhaka, onions were selling between Tk 50 and Tk 60 per kg, up from Tk 35 to Tk 40 just a week earlier.

Sabuj, a vendor who identified himself with a single name, said:  ‚ÄúThe onions have moved from farmers‚Äô fields to cold storage. Prices were low when they were still in the fields.

‚ÄúNow the hoarded stock is being released at higher rates.‚Äù

Al Amin, a seller at Mohakhali market, echoed the same. ‚ÄúThe onions are no longer with the farmers. Large stockpilers now control them in cold storage‚Äù, he said.

‚ÄúIf Indian onions don‚Äôt arrive, prices could go even higher.‚Äù



HOARDING BEHIND THE PRICE SURGE

From farmers to wholesalers, everyone has been stockpiling onions after harvest.

With limited stock reaching the market, farmers say hoarding is largely driving up the prices.

In Rajbari, farmers are already cultivating jute and sesame after harvesting onions, but many still have stocks stored at home.

Only those with high yields are currently selling at local markets.

On Wednesday, at Chandoni onion market in Rajbari Sadar Upazila, farmers were seen bringing onions on their heads, three-wheelers, battery-run rickshaws and even horse-drawn carts.

Depending on quality, the onions were being sold at Tk 1,800 to Tk 2,000 per maund ‚Äì a rise of Tk 400 to Tk 500 from the previous week, leaving many farmers satisfied.



Asked why prices are rising before the season is even over, Chandoni-based onion farmer Afzal Hossain said, ‚ÄúBefore Eid, I sold onions for Tk 1,100 to Tk 1,200 per maund.

‚ÄúThey were fresh then, so it took less quantity to make up a maund. Now that the onions have dried, more weight is needed.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúAlso, farmers like us are storing what we can at home, he added. ‚Äú We plan to sell when the timing is right and prices are better. This is limiting supply in the market.

‚ÄúPlus, the ‚Äòstockpile parties‚Äô are active ‚Äì they buy at whatever price is going and remove the onions from circulation. That‚Äôs why prices are up,‚Äù he explained.

Sulaiman Pramanik, another farmer, said:  ‚ÄúThe main reason is that fresh onions are no longer available. Farmers have stored enough at home.

‚ÄúWith limited supply, large traders are also buying to stockpile, and they‚Äôre accepting current prices without hesitation.‚Äù



Motiar Rahman Munna, a trader at Chandoni Bazar, said: ‚ÄúThere are no onions in the fields now. Farmers are keeping them at home. The market supply is lower than demand.

‚ÄúWhere 500 maunds are needed, only 300 are arriving. That‚Äôs pushing up prices.‚Äù

In Jhenaidah, prices have also gone up. Farmer Nuruzzaman Pappu from Monoharpur cultivated onions on 15 bighas, or 2.01 hectares.

He sold 100 maunds at Tk 1,450 each early on and stored the rest for later sale.

Farmer Shamsul Islam from Bhatbaria stored half of his 200-maund harvest.

COSTS OF ONION FARMING


According to farmers, onion cultivation costs per bigha of land range between Tk 50,000 and Tk 70,000 on average, depending on the location. 
The expense is even higher if land is leased.
Rubel Ahmed, a farmer from Natore's Naldanga, said: ‚ÄúThe pests require treatment every two days. Leasing the land costs between Tk 30,000 and Tk 50,000, with some plots costing as high as Tk 55,000 to Tk 60,000. 
‚ÄúFor one bigha, around 9 to 10 kg of seeds are required, priced at Tk 5,000 per kg (compared with Tk 2,500 to Tk 2,800 per kg at other times).‚Äù
He added, ‚ÄúYou pay Tk 50,000 just for leasing. Then seedlings, labour, fertilisers and pesticides cost Tk 30,000‚Äì40,000. Labour for planting seedlings costs another Tk 12,000. 
‚ÄúIf a bigha yields 60 maunds of onion, the cost per maund stands at Tk 1,500‚Äì2,000. But when harvested, the price was only around Tk 1,200 per maund. 
‚ÄúEven Murikata (early harvest) onions sold for Tk 500‚Äì600. Although prices have slightly increased to Tk 1,500‚Äì2,000, we need Tk 4,000‚Äì5,000 per maund to make a profit.‚Äù
Jahurul Islam, a farmer from Thakur Lakshmikul in Naldanga, said: ‚ÄúIt costs around Tk 23,000 to plant and harvest one bigha of onions. Medicine expenses add up to Tk 20,000, making it a total of Tk 43,000.
‚ÄúIf the land is leased, the cost can go up to Tk 60,000 per bigha. This year, around Tk 60,000 to Tk 70,000 is spent on onion farming,‚Äù he added.



LOSSES AND DEBT: FARMERS TRAPPED
In a tragic case, an elderly onion farmer in Rajshahi took his own life, allegedly due to losses from onion farming. 
Across onion-growing districts, farmers report mixed outcomes‚Äîsome profitable, others burdened with debt due to poor planning or lack of experience.
In Natore, prices recently increased after earlier discontent among farmers. Yet profits remain slim or non-existent.
Ashraful Hossain, a trader from Natore, said: ""A month ago, onions were being sold for Tk 700 to Tk 1,100 per maund in Naldanga, Thakur Lakshmikul, and other markets. 
‚ÄúNow, the price is Tk 1,700 to Tk 2,000 per maund. If Indian onions stop entering the market, the price could rise further.""
Despite the price increase, farmers' profits remain minimal.

Jahurul shared that despite investing heavily, many got poor returns. Driven by the hope of high prices, even rickshaw-pullers leased land to farm onions, only to face losses.
He cited a relative, Md Mintu, who returned from Dhaka, leased four bighas, bought expensive seeds, and ended up losing money due to high input costs.
The pressure of loans has left many farmers struggling to make ends meet. 
Jahurul said: ""Our village is overwhelmed with loans. There‚Äôs no shortage of people lending money at interest rates. Some take loans from NGOs, but not everyone can repay them. Those who cannot often flee to Dhaka.""
Another farmer, Shahidul Islam from Naldanga, echoed similar concerns. ‚ÄúSome farmers with capital lend money at interest. Others lease land for Tk 30,000 and sub-lease for Tk 40,000‚Äîjust to make a profit. It‚Äôs lease on lease. 
‚ÄúThe ones making losses are fleeing to Dhaka.‚Äù
When asked about the main issues, he said: ‚ÄúSeed, fertiliser and pesticide prices are too high. If those came down, and if onion prices increased a bit, farmers could at least break even.‚Äù
Another farmer, Hazrat Ali, said he spent Tk 80, 000 to 90,000 but recovered only Tk 60, 000 to 70,000. 

OVERPRODUCTION VS ACCURATE DATA
According to Natore‚Äôs Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) Deputy Director Md Habibul Islam Khan, while the target for onion cultivation in the district this year was 4,060 hectares, actual coverage reached 7,050 hectares. 
Due to favourable weather and absence of pests, both production and supply have increased.
Asked how to ensure fair prices for crops, Bangladesh Agricultural University agricultural economist Prof AHM Saiful Islam said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve long struggled to determine actual supply and demand. 
‚ÄúBecause of this, off-season overproduction often leads to price hikes or shortages.‚Äù
He added, ‚ÄúI think the government needs to review its existing data. Proper statistics on production, supply and demand are crucial‚Äînot just for onions, but for potatoes, rice and other crops. 
‚ÄúWith accurate data, government planning would be easier, and price instability could be addressed.‚Äù
On middlemen, he noted: ‚ÄúIn our research, we found that direct marketing sometimes increases costs. Some middlemen are necessary in the supply chain‚Äîbut we must ensure the chain isn‚Äôt too long.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThe market must be monitored to function properly as a competitive market. It must not turn into a monopoly. With proper oversight, competition can help ensure fair prices,‚Äù he concluded.

LIMITED PROFIT IN SOME DISTRICTS
While farmers in Natore are yet to see profits, growers in Rajbari district say although the gains are limited, they are not incurring losses either.
Visits to local markets reveal that onion prices have increased by Tk 10 to Tk 15 per Kg.
Currently, onions are being sold at Tk 50 per kg in retail markets, compared with Tk 35 last week.
Imran Khan, an onion farmer from Kalukhali Upazila, explains that onion seeds cost around Tk 20,000 per bigha. 
Labour costs are an additional TK 10,000, and expenses for land preparation, fertilisers, pesticides, and irrigation add another Tk 20,000, bringing the total cost to Tk 50,000 per bigha. 
If leasing the land, an additional Tk 30,000 is required.
The farmer said, ""Good yields can result in 70 to 75 mounds of onions per bigha, and lower yields would be around 55 to 60 mounds. At an average price of Tk 15 per mound, 60 mounds bring in Tk 90,000, and 70 mounds bring in Tk 105,000. 
‚ÄúTherefore, a farmer should not face any loss. There might be a small profit after covering production costs, but a loss is unlikely.""
Imran believes that farmers in Rajbari do not engage in ""Dadon"" (loan) practices, and no loans are provided by NGOs for onion farming. 
Farmers typically buy fertilisers, pesticides, and other materials on credit with the understanding that they will pay once the onions are sold.
In response to claims that farmers have faced high costs and losses, he says he has kept records of the costs for farming on more than three bighas of land. 
""I think most farmers do not maintain records, which leads them to believe that their costs are higher than they are,"" he adds.
Golam Rasul, the district training officer at DAE‚Äôs Rajbari office, said 14 percent of the country's total onion production comes from Rajbari. 
This year, onions have been planted on 37,283 hectares of land in the district, including 5,870 hectares of ""Murikata,"" 31,271 hectares of ""Hali,"" and 142 hectares of ""Kodom"" onions.
 The target for onion production is 525,000 tonnes, and at current market prices, farmers are not facing losses.
In Jhenaidah, another district seeing record onion cultivation this year, 13,712 hectares of land have been used for onion farming. 
Locally, domestic onions are being sold at prices ranging from Tk 1,800 to 2,000 per mound, while the Indian variety ""Sukh Sagar"" is priced between Tk 1,400 and 1,500 per mound.

Sasty Chandra Roy, the deputy director of Jhenaidah DAE, noted that 80 percent of the onion crops this year have had good yields, while 20 percent have seen lower yields. 
Those who adopted late planting techniques have experienced reduced yields.

                        Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that tariff and trade wars undermine the legitimate rights and interests of all countries, hurt the multilateral trading system and impact the world economic order, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

Xi made the comments during a meeting with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev in Beijing, where he said that China is willing to work with Azerbaijan to safeguard the international system and carry out ""in-depth"" law enforcement and security cooperation with the Azerbaijan side.

""China is ready to work with the Azerbaijan side to uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core...and safeguard international fairness and justice,"" Xinhua said.

The two leaders announced ""the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Azerbaijan"". It included the signing of 20 cooperation documents as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in areas including legal, green development, digital economy, intellectual property rights, and aerospace.

" Florida sues Snapchat owner for allegedly addicting children, deceiving parents ","
                        
                        
                        Florida sued Snap, the owner of photo-sharing app Snapchat, on Tuesday, accusing it of illegally employing features that addict children and opening accounts for children age 13 and younger.

The complaint said Snapchat features including infinite scrolling, push notifications, auto-play videos, and metrics that provide user feedback violate a 2024 state law signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, and designed to protect children's mental health from compulsive social media exposure.

Florida called Snap's conduct ""particularly egregious"" because the Santa Monica, California-based company markets Snapchat as safe for 13-year-olds though it can be used to view pornography and buy drugs, among other harmful activities.

By failing to remove 13-year-old users and require parental consent for 14- and 15-year-old users, ""Snap is actively deceiving Florida parents about the risks of allowing their teens to access this platform,"" the complaint said.

The complaint was announced by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and filed in a Santa Rosa County state court, in the state's panhandle. Uthmeier and DeSantis are Republicans.

In a statement, Snap said Florida's law infringes the First Amendment constitutional rights of adults and children.

Snap also said there are ""more privacy-conscious solutions"" at the operating system, app store and device level to address online safety and age verification.

Two technology industry trade groups, NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association, are challenging the Florida law's constitutionality in the federal court in Tallahassee, the state's capital.

 Trump meets with US retailers to discuss tariffs ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump met with major retailers, including Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe's and Target, on Monday to discuss broad-based tariffs likely to raise the cost of everyday goods that they import.

 

Big US chains, like Walmart and Target, rely heavily on imported goods, and tariffs ‚Äî including 145% levies on China ‚Äî are expected to add strain on Americans already burdened by prolonged inflation.

 

""We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights,"" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement, without elaborating. The retailer previously said its CEO, Doug McMillon, would be in attendance.

 

This marks McMillon's first meeting with Trump since the introduction of the president's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. Earlier in April, McMillon said the two had not personally discussed tariffs, although other members of Walmart's leadership had been in regular contact with his administration.

 

Trump's erratic tariff policies have sent ripples across numerous industries and roiled US stock markets for weeks. More recently he has expressed anger at remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said last week the economy was at risk from both lower growth and higher inflation.

 

US markets sold off on Monday, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury note and the US dollar also came under pressure.

 

He announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries on April 2, before pausing the duties for a 90-day period - except those on China, singling out the world's second-largest economy for the biggest levies.

 

A Home Depot spokesperson characterised the meeting as ""informative and constructive."" A Target representative said its CEO Brian Cornell was in attendance at the ""productive meeting...to discuss the path forward on trade.""

 

Lowe's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 

More than half of Walmart and Target's imports are from China, according to company figures, while both Home Depot and Lowe's also import from that nation.

 

Analysts are concerned that these retailers would see a substantial hit to their profit margins as a result of tariffs.

 

Walmart shares are up less than 2% in 2025, while the others have all posted double-digit losses. Target has been hit hardest, down 32% so far this year.

" Labour Reform Commission recommends minimum wage, emergency pay fund for workers ","
                        
                        
                        The Labour Reform Commission has recommended introducing a national minimum wage and making Bangladesh‚Äôs labour laws ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù to safeguard workers' rights across all sectors.
To address labour unrest, it has also proposed creating a wage payment fund capable of covering two months‚Äô salaries for workers in export-oriented industries.
The commission, headed by Syed Sultan Uddin Ahmed, executive director of the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS), submitted its report to Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus on Monday.
Later in the afternoon, Sultan presented a summary of the findings at a press conference at the Sromo Bhaban, or Labour Building, in Dhaka‚Äôs Bijoynagar.
‚ÄúMost workers in the country are unrecognised,‚Äù Sultan said. ‚ÄúThat is why we have proposed universal labour rights. The identity of workers in every sector must be ensured.‚Äù
News of workers' exploitation in both the country's export sector and local industries often makes headlines.
The apparel sector, in particular, frequently sees protests, strikes, blockades, and vandalism, primarily due to dissatisfaction over unpaid wages.
The commission placed a strong emphasis on timely wage payments as a means to prevent labour unrest.
It has suggested imposing daily fines on factory owners who fail to pay wages on time.


In order to ensure wage payments during emergencies such as natural disasters, export disruptions, or factory closures, the panel proposed setting up a dedicated fund.
Entrepreneurs will be required to deposit the equivalent of two months‚Äô wages for their workers into the fund.
The fund will be managed jointly by the entrepreneurs, the Department of Labour, and government representatives.
In times of need, either the entrepreneurs or the government can use the funds to pay workers.
In response to a question, Sultan said: ""Here [in the export sector], the issue of workers' outstanding salaries and allowances arises. There is a risk of sudden export cessation or delays in receiving payments.
‚ÄúEvery district currently has an assigned government representative to look after the welfare of informal sector workers,‚Äù he added.
The report also recommends reclassifying industrial entrepreneurs as ‚Äúemployers‚Äù instead of ‚Äúowners‚Äù in labour laws.
It proposes that even workers hired for a single day must receive a contract or identification document.
The commission has also advocated for the creation of a central database encompassing all workers nationwide.
Sultan said: ‚ÄúWorkers in the service sector who are self-employed will be able to register themselves on the database website.
‚ÄúThis registration will serve as their worker identification.""
The reform commission believes this method can help identify independent workers such as fishermen, rickshaw-pullers, day labourers, and street vendors.
Currently, a certain proportion of total workers' support is required for workers in any industry to form a trade union.
The commission proposes allowing unions to form based on a fixed number of workers instead and recommends simplifying the bargaining process.
Sultan said there are 80 million workers in the country, most of whom lack legal protection.
To address this, the commission‚Äôs report calls for the establishment of a national minimum wage.
The report also recommends replacing the word ‚Äúfemale‚Äù with ‚Äúwoman‚Äù in labour laws.
It advises developing and implementing an anti-sexual harassment policy in line with the 2009 High Court directive.
It also proposes extending maternity leave to six months in all institutions.
In addition, the commission recommends swift withdrawal of cases filed against workers during recent labour protests.
Sultan said the 458-page report was prepared over five months through discussions with workers, entrepreneurs, and small and medium business owners across the country.
Divided into four parts, the report offers 25 key recommendations.

 Air Astra wants Airbus planes to operate on international routes ,"
                        
                        
                        The latest privately-owned Bangladeshi airline Air Astra seeks to procure three to four Airbus jets to fly international routes two and a half years after its launch.

The company called for proposals involving ‚ÄúDRY/OPERATING LEASE or OUTRIGHT PURCHASE‚Äù of Airbus aircraft from the A320 and A321 series on their website and Facebook page.

The A320 and A321 models are quite popular narrow-body jets for medium-haul flights. Different airlines keep the two models in their preferred queue due to their fuel efficiency and operational comfort.

When asked, Sakib Hasan Shuvo, Air Astra deputy manager (public relations), told bdnews24.com: ""We have already started the process of procuring aircraft internally. Now we have officially invited proposals. We want to buy Airbus aircraft.""

Air Astra had expressed interest in operating flights to Kathmandu or Pokhara in Nepal in early 2024. However, their services have so far remained within the country.

When asked about this, Shuvo said: ‚ÄúInitially, we planned to start flights to Nepal with the aircraft currently in the fleet. But after some deliberation, we have moved away from that plan.‚Äù

Air Astra has taken to flying to new international destinations in the latest initiative, seeking aircraft with economy cabins. However, they have no objection to adding two-class aircraft to the fleet.

According to the company's announcement, those interested must deliver the aircraft by this year. The jets must be less than 15 years old at the time of delivery.

Asked on which international routes Air Astra planned to fly, Shuvo said: ""If the planes are procured, we will consider Phuket in Thailand, Johor Bahru in Malaysia, Kathmandu or Pokhara in Nepal as options for destinations.""

Regarding when flight operations can start, Shuvo said: ""There are many factors involved here. However, we would like to operate flights on international routes by 2025.""

Air Astra launched commercial flights on domestic routes on Nov 24, 2022. The airline now has four ATR 72-600 aircraft in its collection.

These jets currently fly on Dhaka, Cox's Bazar, Chaittogram, Saidpur and Jashore routes.

Trump signed an order on Wednesday aimed at reviving US shipbuilding and reducing China's grip on the global shipping industry. His government the next day watered the measures down by shielding domestic exporters and vessel owners serving the Great Lakes, the Caribbean and US territories.

 

The spat over ocean shipping, which conveys 80% of global trade, is the latest conflict in an intensifying trade war between China and the US that has pushed levies on each other's imports beyond 100%.

 

The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry expressed ""extreme indignation and resolute opposition"" to the US measures, joining protests from the government and country's shipowners.

 

""The decline of the US shipbuilding industry is the result of its protectionism and has nothing to do with China,"" the shipbuilders said in a statement.

 

It warned the US restrictions would disrupt the global maritime system, lead to soaring shipping costs, further push up US inflation and harm the interest of the US people.

 

""We call on the international maritime industry to jointly resist this short-sighted U.S. behaviour, and jointly maintain a fair market environment,"" the industry body said, adding it expects Chinese authorities to take strong countermeasures.

 

The government protested against the ""discriminatory"" steps on Friday, urging Washington to ""correct wrongdoings.""

 

The Ministry of Commerce vowed in a statement to ""resolutely take necessary measures to safeguard our own interests"", saying the fees ""fully reveal the essence of its unilateralist and protectionist policies, and are typical, non-market practices"".

 Use of Bangladeshi credit cards in India sees steep 73% decline ,"
                        
                        
                        The steady decline in credit card transactions by Bangladeshi citizens in India, first observed during the July Uprising last year, has grown more pronounced.
In February, India dropped to sixth place among foreign destinations, with transactions plummeting 73.15 percent compared to the same period in the previous year.
As in previous months, the United States remains the top destination for Bangladeshi credit card spending.
Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom follow.
These findings were drawn from a monthly report issued by Bangladesh Bank, titled ‚ÄúAn Overview of Credit Card Usage Pattern Within and Outside Bangladesh.‚Äù
According to the report, Bangladeshis spent Tk 3.83 billion abroad using credit cards in February of this year.
The figure was Tk 4.45 billion in January.
This represents a month-to-month decrease of 13.93 percent in foreign spending via credit cards.
In contrast, Bangladeshis spent Tk 4.99 billion abroad through credit cards in February 2024.
Among all foreign destinations, the highest amount was spent in the United States in February this year‚ÄîTk 520 million.
That figure was Tk 680 million in January.
Thailand ranked second, where Bangladeshis spent Tk 460 million in February.
In January, they spent Tk 640 million.
Singapore saw an increase in credit card spending by Bangladeshis in February, with expenditures rising by Tk 10 million to a total of Tk 390 million.
Malaysia, however, witnessed a decline.
Bangladeshis spent Tk 300 million there in February, down from Tk 350 million in January. As such, the country has secured the fourth position.
The United Kingdom matched Malaysia in February, with Bangladeshi credit card spending totalling Tk 300 million, compared to Tk 330 million in January.
India, now in sixth place, saw spending by Bangladeshi citizens fall to Tk 290 million in February.
In January, the figure stood at Tk 320 million.
This marks a dramatic shift from a year ago, when Bangladeshis spent more than three times that amount in India using credit cards.
In February 2024, the total reached Tk 1.08 billion.
Bangladesh Bank, which began publishing this data in 2023, had shown India as the top destination for Bangladeshi credit card usage.
The United States, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia had trailed behind.
That pattern held steady until July 2024.
India imposed visa restrictions following the July Uprising that led to the ousting of the Awami League government.
As a result, travel from Bangladesh to India has fallen significantly, triggering a drop in credit card usage in the neighbouring country.
In July of last year, Bangladeshis spent Tk 730 million on credit cards in India.
The month prior, in June, the figure was even higher at Tk 920 million.
A senior official at Bangladesh Bank, speaking to bdnews24.com, confirmed that travel to India by Bangladeshi citizens has decreased since the change in government in August.
He added that earlier data consistently showed India as the top location for credit card transactions by Bangladeshis abroad.
According to him, recent patterns indicate that Bangladeshis are now opting more for destinations such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand instead of India.
The central bank‚Äôs report also includes data on foreign nationals using credit cards while visiting Bangladesh.
In February, foreign citizens spent Tk 2.68 billion in Bangladesh through credit card transactions.
That figure stood at Tk 2.52 billion in January.
This marks a 6.35 percent increase in foreign spending within Bangladesh over a single month.
Here too, the United States ranks first.
American citizens spent Tk 880 million in Bangladesh.
The United Kingdom follows, with its citizens spending Tk 270 million.
India comes in third, with Indian nationals spending Tk 160 million in Bangladesh using credit cards.

 Bangladesh SMEs grapple with uncertainty as yarn imports via land are suspended ,"
                        
                        
                        The interim government's decision to suspend yarn imports from India via land borders‚Äîfollowing pressure from domestic mills eager to expand their market share‚Äîhas left small and medium enterprises (SMEs) jittery.

Many fear the move could erode their competitiveness in the export market, tightening access to affordable raw materials and threatening their foothold in global supply chains.

Stakeholders believe the government‚Äôs decision will hit the small and medium businesses hard in the knitwear sector, especially those who import yarn from India at low prices by land against small purchase orders.

Moreover, some worry that it will allow domestic mills ‚Äúsyndicate‚Äù to get stronger.

Leaders of business organisations have sought a review of the decision by the National Board of Revenue (NBR), who made the decision public on Tuesday.

Kazi Mostafizur Rahman, in charge of audit, modernisation and international trade at the NBR, told bdnews24.com: ""No review is being held.""

Under the retracted order issued on Aug 29, 2024, 100 percent of export-oriented industries with customs bond licences were allowed to import yarn via these land ports. Imports through land ports were still restricted for other businesses.

With the latest order, the NBR imposed a blanket ban on all yarn imports via the land ports.



Previously, yarn imports from India were only routed through five land ports, including Benapole, Bhomra, Sonamasjid, Banglabandha and Burimari.

COMPLAINTS ON HIGH-COUNT YARN

The biggest buyers of yarn in Bangladesh are the ready-made garment and textile sectors. Alongside imports, they meet their demands through domestic mills as well.

The maximum count of yarn used in the ready-made garment sector is 30 to 32. Depending on the type of fabric to be made or the purpose for which it will be used, the count helps determine the quality of the yarn.

The yarn count is set at a maximum of 100 with the number indicating the weight and quality of yarn. The higher the number, the more the weight and thicker the yarn.

The Ministry of Commerce has stopped importing yarn from India through land ports at the request of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA).

Bangladesh garment sector received a huge portion of yarns through import from India, mostly through the Benapole port.

Indian traders used to store yarns manufactured in the northern and southern regions in Kolkata, and from there it used to be transported to by land.

The price of these yarns coming through Benapole port was lower than the price of yarns coming through sea ports. And the BTMA had been complaining that the low-priced yarns had been detrimental to the domestic textile mills.

Why not import yarn from India if it is available at a lower price, BKMEA President Mohammad Hatem has asked.

BTMA, however, has presented two reasons in favour of the NBR‚Äôs decision.



The first is to protect domestic mills; the second is that 60 count and even 80 count yarns are being imported in the name of low count yarn, although high count yarns are not used in the ready-made garment sector. Those yarns arrive in Bangladesh for use in the domestic market.

The ready-made garment sector gets back-to-back letters-of-credit facilities for yarn imports. So, these yarns imported for use in export goods are duty-free. Only customs charges have to be paid.

Another reason the BTMA presented for opposing the import is that the entry of yarns ‚Äúin excess of the LC declaration‚Äù into the country‚Äôs market was harming the government and domestic mills.

According to government and commercial organisations, the amount of yarn imports into Bangladesh had gone up over the past few years.

BTMA data says Bangladesh imported 1.21 million tons of yarn from India last year, which is 31.45 percent more than the previous year. In 2023, the imports were 924 thousand tons.

On the other hand, data published by the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry says the country exported over $1.30 billion worth of yarn to Bangladesh in the 2023-24 fiscal year, which was 34.57 percent more than the previous fiscal year.

In the 2023-24 fiscal year, yarn worth $971.6 million came from India. According to Bangladesh Bank data, in that financial year, Bangladesh imported a total of $2.93 billion worth of yarn from different countries.

Faruque Hassan, former president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), has pointed to a cut in incentives for the textile sector as a reason for the rise in yarn imports from India last year.

Speaking to bdnews24.com, he said: ‚ÄúThe government reduced incentives for the textile sector from 4 percent to 1.5 percent, which lowered the competitiveness of local mills in terms of yarn prices.

‚ÄúIn addition, gas prices have increased several times, raising production costs.‚Äù

He also noted that Bangladesh‚Äôs garment exports have grown, resulting in increased demand and subsequently higher yarn imports from India.



ENTREPRENEURS PRESENT COUNTERARGUMENTS

The textile and knitting mills import cotton to produce yarn for the ready-made garment sector.

Most of the cotton required for the country comes from India.

Alongside its own production, India also exports cotton to Bangladesh sourced from Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan.

India had stopped exporting yarn to Bangladesh through land ports in 2011.

Later, due to persistent efforts from Indian traders, land port-based exports were resumed for Bangladesh.

According to BKMEA President Hatem, Indian traders can offer yarn at 30 cents (equivalent to Tk 36.60) less per kg than local mills, prompting entrepreneurs to prefer imports from India.

‚ÄúWe can save up to Tk 500,000 per lot. Why shouldn‚Äôt we import? We have to remain competitive in business,‚Äù said the businessman.

He added that if domestic mills could offer yarn at that rate, he would have no objection to buying locally.



‚ÄúMost yarn comes via sea route, and there‚Äôs no issue there. We get it cheaper than local mills, who should be the ones offering competitive rates by increasing their capacity,‚Äù Hatem said.

 Mohammad Ayub Hossain, an advisor to the Bangladesh Cotton Association (BCA), said: ‚ÄúBangladesh doesn‚Äôt produce cotton‚Äîit‚Äôs entirely imported.

‚ÄúIndia, on the other hand, has its own cotton and lower gas prices. That‚Äôs why their production cost is lower and they can offer cheaper prices.

‚ÄúIn Bangladesh, both transport and production costs are higher.‚Äù

He noted that yarn prices do not remain high at all times.

‚ÄúLike daily commodities, yarn prices fluctuate,‚Äù Ayub added. ‚ÄúWhen demand rises, prices go up; when demand falls, prices drop.

‚ÄúIf you average the rates over a year, the difference isn‚Äôt significant‚Äîaround 10 to 20 cents.‚Äù

The apparel export sector in the country includes small, medium, and large companies, with small and medium ones making up the majority in terms of numbers.

Buyers often place small orders on short notice, which mostly go to these smaller factories.

In business terms, the competition revolves around who can deliver the goods faster‚Äîwho has the shortest lead time.

Small and medium-sized factories in Bangladesh have long relied on importing yarn from India by road, adjusting shipments to match immediate production needs.

Trucks carrying seven to eight tonnes of yarn typically pass through land ports, offering a practical and efficient solution for manufacturers.

This facilitates faster processing of letters of credit (LCs) and allows entrepreneurs to secure bank financing with relative ease.



Mohiuddin Rubel, a former director of the BGMEA, expressed concern over the government‚Äôs recent decision to stop yarn imports via land routes.

He warned that such a move could disrupt operations for smaller firms.

‚ÄúSmall companies become medium-sized, then dream of becoming big. Today‚Äôs big companies were once small,‚Äù Rubel told bdnews24.com.

‚ÄúNow the problems of small and medium-sized companies have increased, their competitiveness has decreased, and lead time has decreased.‚Äù

The government has announced that all yarn imports must now arrive by sea or air.

While sea transport may reduce costs, it necessitates importing in bulk, which increases the financial burden and extends the time required for delivery.

Rubel noted that this change could impact the country‚Äôs export competitiveness.

‚ÄúThe reduction in lead time means that buyers will calculate how much time Bangladesh can deliver. If someone can deliver in less time, the order will go to them,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIn this way, a part of the export order may be lost.‚Äù
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH LAND PORTS?

There is currently no functional machinery at Bangladesh‚Äôs land ports to verify the quality of yarn during import.

A yarn-counting machine, previously provided by the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), has reportedly broken down, leading to discrepancies between declared and delivered yarn counts.

Hatem said: ‚ÄúIf there is a problem with measuring yarn, BKMEA will buy a counting machine. The land port can measure the yarn with that machine and see how many counts of yarn have been brought. Then there is no problem.

‚ÄúBut stopping imports is not a solution to the problem.‚Äù



He argued that land-based imports should remain an option for manufacturers, alongside shipments by sea.

‚ÄúWe have to keep alternative options open. There needs to be multiple options in imports,‚Äù he said.

According to the BTMA, the cost of yarn imported through Benapole land port is lower than that of yarn shipped through seaports.

The association submitted a formal letter to the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission presenting this position.

In response, the Ministry of Commerce issued a directive to all land ports, citing the price disparity between yarn imported from India via land and yarn sourced from China, Turkey, Uzbekistan, or domestic producers.

Although prices from these regions are largely similar, Indian yarn delivered through land routes is significantly cheaper.

This pricing gap, the ministry noted, has put domestic yarn producers at a disadvantage.

Yarn brought in through land ports reportedly arrives at rates far below those declared at the Chittagong Custom House, making it harder for local manufacturers to remain competitive.

Despite repeated efforts, BTMA President Showkat Aziz Russell could not be reached for comment.

" Onion price leaps from Tk 35 to Tk 60 in a week, vegetables stay costly ","
                        
                        
                        Despite the uptick in summer vegetable availability, market prices have fluctuated little, remaining anchored at the previous week‚Äôs rates.
But the same cannot be said for onions and bottled soyabean oil, which have seen a rise in prices over the week.
A visit to Dhaka‚Äôs Mohakhali, Sattola and Niketan kitchen markets on Friday revealed that onions were selling for Tk 50‚Äì60 per kg, up by Tk 10‚Äì20 from last week.
Sellers say the price of this staple may continue to rise gradually as the season draws to a close.
‚ÄúLast week onions were selling at Tk 35 to 40. Now we‚Äôre forced to sell at Tk 50 to 60 per kg as prices have gone up wholesale,‚Äù said Faruk Hossain, owner of Ripa General Store at Sattola market.
‚ÄúThe season is over for onions, and that‚Äôs when prices typically climb,‚Äù he added.
The buyers, however, are not convinced by the explanation.
Mohammad Riaz, a private jobholder who came to buy onions at the market, told bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say prices have risen wholesale. But these traders don‚Äôt bring in fresh stock daily. Surely this is old stock.
‚ÄúThey could have sold it at the previous rate, but they won‚Äôt.‚Äù
Another buyer, Jesmin Begum, said: ‚ÄúI bought onions for Tk 35 per kg about a week ago. Now the better ones are Tk 60, the rest are Tk 50.
‚ÄúHad I known, I‚Äôd have stocked up. I run a small hotel ‚Äî onions are essential for me.‚Äù


At Mohakhali kitchen market, vendor Al Amin said: ‚ÄúThis year, Ramadan coincided with the onion and vegetable season, so prices were low. Now farmers are out of stock.
‚ÄúThe remaining onions are in cold storage with wholesalers, and they‚Äôll now control the supply and raise prices.
‚ÄúIt might go up even more,‚Äù he added.
OLD STOCK OIL BEING SOLD AT NEW PRICE
The interim government has raised the price of bottled soyabean oil by Tk 14 per litre after five months in response to traders‚Äô demands.
Although the newly priced bottles have not yet fully entered the market, vendors are already selling old stock at the revised rate.
The new official price for a one-litre bottle has been fixed at Tk 189, while the five-litre bottle now costs from Tk 852 to Tk 922.
The price of loose soyabean oil has also gone up by Tk 12, now set at Tk 169 per litre.
On Sunday, Commerce Advisor Sheikh Bashir Uddin said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve revised the prices of soyabean oil based on the international market and [Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission] formula.‚Äù
‚ÄúAccording to the formula, each litre of [soyabean] oil costs Tk 197,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut we set the price after discussing it with industry stakeholders.‚Äù
Citing the withdrawal of tax exemption benefits as the reason for the price hike, the advisor said: ""The government exempted tax for cooking oil.
‚ÄúThis caused a Tk 5.5 billion drop in revenue collection per month.""
The previous price adjustment took place on Dec 9, 2024, when the rate was raised to Tk 175 per litre.
Despite this, market supply had not returned to normal even after five months.
Buyers had complained of paying more than the labelled price and being forced to buy extra items with the oil.
Shoppers on Friday shared similar concerns with bdnews24.com, saying some vendors were selling bottles labelled Tk 175 at the latest rate.
Md Hafez, a customer at Sattola Market, said: ‚ÄúI bought bottled oil for Tk 190 [on Thursday]. The bottle is labelled as Tk 175.


‚ÄúWhen I asked about it, the seller said he had to purchase it at a higher price and wouldn‚Äôt make a profit if he sold it at the labelled rate.‚Äù
Vendor Jewel Mia from the same market said the newly priced bottles would start arriving within a few days, after which the confusion over pricing would no longer be an issue, as sellers would also be purchasing at the adjusted rates.
PRICES OF SUMMER VEGETABLES HOLD STEADY
Although prices of summer vegetables remain somewhat high, they have shown little change this week, with most items selling at last week‚Äôs rates.
In Dhaka‚Äôs retail markets, aubergines are selling for Tk 60 to 80 each kg, bitter gourd for Tk 70 to 80, yardlong beans for Tk 90, pointed gourd for Tk 70 to 80, okra for Tk 60, sponge gourd for Tk 70 to 80, snake gourd for Tk 80, and taro stolon for Tk 80.
Spiny gourd, however, is drawing attention for its high price, retailing at Tk 130 to 140 a kg.
Moringa drumsticks are also on the higher end at Tk 140.
Papaya at Tk 50, and green chillies range between Tk 60 and 80 per kg.
Among winter vegetables, flat beans are selling at Tk 60 to 80 per kg while bottle gourd is priced at Tk 60 to 70 apiece.
Depending on the size, ripe tomatoes cost Tk 30 to 50 per kg, carrots Tk 50, radish Tk 60, and cucumber Tk 50 to 60.
Prices for lemons, which had soared during Ramadan, have eased to Tk 20 to 40 per four-piece pack.
Coriander leaves are selling at Tk 140 per kg, green bananas at Tk 40 per four, capsicum at Tk 150 a kg, and sweet pumpkin at Tk 30 to 40.
Larger ash gourds are available for Tk 50 to 60 apiece.
Zainal Hossain, a vegetable trader at Niketan kitchen market, said: ‚ÄúPrices of summer vegetables are still slightly elevated. It‚Äôll take a bit more time for rates to fall. We‚Äôre hoping prices will ease as supply increases.‚Äù

" In US Chinatowns, merchants ‚Äòdon‚Äôt want the trade war to be a war‚Äô ","
                        
                        
                        Last week, a pack of rice crackers at Sun Vin Grocery store on Mulberry Street in New York City‚Äôs Chinatown cost $4.99.

But this week, after President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs on items imported from China took effect, the same crackers have a new price: $6.99.

Chinatowns across the US are feeling the effects of the escalating tariff war, as prices of household goods imported from China, including traditional Chinese medicine, dried noodles and jade jewelry have already started to rise.

While Trump paused his tariffs on most of the world for 90 days, his tit-for-tat trade war with China has resulted in a steep 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and that‚Äôs hitting mostly family-owned small businesses in Chinatown hard. Many immigrant Chinese communities rely on businesses in local Chinatowns across the country for goods that are central to Chinese culture, for which there are few, if any, alternatives.

‚ÄúIt will impact a lot,‚Äù said Jasmine Bai, the manager of Sun Vin Grocery, a small store stocked mostly with products imported from China, including ingredients that are rarely found in American grocery stores, like bean thread noodles and lotus seed paste. ‚ÄúIn the future, maybe we have less clients and they will buy less food.‚Äù

Chinatown residents in Lower Manhattan spend $1.15 billion each year on retail goods and services, and about 80 percent of local businesses in the neighbourhood directly serve the Chinese community, according to New York City‚Äôs Small Business Services.

Trump has said that he believes the United States could make a deal with China, but maintains that Beijing has ""really taken advantage"" of the US for a long time.

""Every Nation, including China, wants to meet!‚Äù Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, although Beijing officials have not yet indicated that they are planning to meet with the White House. China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125 percent on US imports.

On Thursday, China's commerce ministry urged the US to stop putting ""extreme pressure"" on the country and said the two sides remained at an impasse over who should start trade talks.



SENSE OF CHAOS

That back-and-forth has injected a sense of chaos into Chinatown businesses, said Eva Sam, the owner of Popular Jewelry in New York City, a family business known for chains and pendants with ornate gemstones popular with hip hop artists.

""The sudden changes and escalating tariffs make it nearly impossible to stabilise prices or offer consistent quotes to our clients,"" she said.

Popular Jewelry sources its 24-karat gold as well as cut and polished jade stones from China. The store has already had to raise prices by 10 percent on imported jewelry, Sam said.

""It's very hard to make long-term and short-term decisions, because you don't know if the tariffs are going to be permanent or where he's going to put the tariffs, or if he's going to take them off,"" said William Wong, Sam's son who also works at Popular Jewelry.

Most Chinatown stores in New York City only have one or two months of supplies stockpiled, according to Welcome to Chinatown, a local nonprofit aimed at supporting businesses in the neighbourhood.

That includes Villy KX Pharmacy, which doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúkeep a lot of stuff‚Äù on hand, said Daniel Dellaratta, a pharmacist who has been working in Chinatown for 30 years.

‚ÄúWe are expecting, within the next 90 days, to see significant increases on most of the generic products,‚Äù he said.

Eliz Digital Inc, a photo shop in New York City‚Äôs Chinatown, has also seen the prices of supplies, like paper and chemicals sourced in China and used for developing photographs, increase.

Although the store has not raised prices ‚Äúfor a long, long time,‚Äù the tariffs could force their hand, said the store‚Äôs owner, who asked only to be referred to by her last name, Kesh.

‚ÄúI think eventually we might have to do something, because, as you see, everything has gone up a lot, and our supply has definitely gone up so much,‚Äù she said.

AMERICA‚ÄôS OLDEST CHINATOWN

San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown is also experiencing uncertainty among its businesses as owners hope for productive negotiations between the US and China, said Edward Siu, chairman of the Chinatown Merchants United Association of San Francisco.

‚ÄúA lot of people don‚Äôt know what will be next. They are so worried and frustrated right now,‚Äù said Siu, who has been operating a travel agency in the neighbourhood for 40 years.

The neighbourhood, which spans 30 densely populated blocks, constitutes the oldest Chinese American community in the United States, according to the city's planning department.

It‚Äôs a tight-knit network of residents and businesses has weathered multiple crises since the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain issues and slow economic recovery in the city.

Selena Lee, who owns Linda Boutique, a jade jewelry store on Chinatown's iconic Grant Avenue, said the prices on her latest delivery tripled as the tariffs took effect. While the raw jade material in her jewelry is from Myanmar, the finished products are imported from China.

‚ÄúIf we change, we have to change the whole format of the business, which is not easy,‚Äù she said.

Mei Zhu, who runs a small grocery store on Stockton Street, is also concerned about running short on inventory as customers have tried to stock up on products in anticipation of higher prices.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing left to sell,‚Äù Zhu said, pointing to an empty cardboard box labelled ‚Äúsalt,‚Äù explaining that many customers have bought as many as ten cans at once, even though her store does not import salt from China.

Siu urged the American and Chinese governments to consider the people affected by their policies, such as him and other Chinese American business owners.

‚ÄúRight now, we‚Äôre in the danger zone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want the trade war to be a war.‚Äù

 Boeing jet returns to US from China amid tariff war ,"
                        
                        
                        A Boeing jet that arrived at a completion plant near Shanghai last month was returning to the US, flight tracking data showed on Friday, in a sign that at least one Chinese airline could be halting deliveries due to US tariffs.

 

The US planemaker was reported earlier this week to face a Chinese ban on its imports, part of an escalating confrontation over US President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" global tariffs, though industry sources said the status of rules remained unclear.

 

In a sign that Boeing was preparing for normal business just weeks before Trump announced tariffs on Apr 2, tracking data showed at least four new 737 MAX planes sitting at a completion and delivery centre in Zhoushan, where Boeing installs interiors and paints liveries before handing aircraft to customers in China.

 

Three arrived from Boeing in Seattle in March and one arrived last week, according to Flightradar24.

 

On Friday morning one of those jets departed Zhoushan for Guam - one of the stops such flights make as they cross the Pacific Ocean before reaching Seattle - indicating it was making the return journey, tracking data shows.

 

Photos posted to planespotting websites in February showed it was decorated with a livery for Xiamen Airlines, which is majority owned by China Southern 600029.SS. One source said the plane was expected to be delivered to Xiamen.

 

In 2024 it was spotted in the US with a Shandong Airlines livery and in 2018 with the Air China 601111.SS logo, other photos showed.

 

None of those airlines immediately responded to requests for comment.

 

Aviation publication The Air Current on Thursday reported that the first of three of the four recently arrived planes had been tagged to be recalled to the United States without a handover.

 

Boeing declined to comment.

 

Boeing deliveries to China have previously been disrupted at times of tension between Washington and Beijing. In January 2024 MAX deliveries resumed after an almost five-year import freeze.

 

The planemaker opened the plant southeast of Shanghai in 2018 under the shadow of a previous round of trade tensions during Trump's first presidency.

 

Although Boeing has not followed Airbus AIR.PA in assembling full airplanes in China, analysts said the aim was to build a lead in one of the world's largest air travel markets.

 

Airline and aerospace industry sources said there was no confirmation of a formal ban on Boeing deliveries, reported earlier this week by Bloomberg News, but that the imposition of tariffs would effectively block imports for the time being.

 

Beijing has also asked that Chinese carriers halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies, the Bloomberg report said.

 

A senior industry source said Boeing and suppliers are planning on the basis that it would not be delivering planes to China for the time being.

 

However, two US industry sources said they were given no clear instructions not to ship parts to China. A separate source, who runs a maintenance and repair shop for aircraft in China, said they have not had any issues importing American parts.

 

China's foreign ministry declined to comment.

 

Asked by media about the reported ban, a spokesperson said: ""I'd refer you to competent authorities"".

 

DELIVERY LIMBO

 

For aerospace, Zhoushan is the latest staging post in a growing US-led trade war. Planemakers, airlines and suppliers are reviewing contracts after Reuters reported that US supplier Howmet Aerospace HWM.N had ignited a debate over the cost of tariffs by declaring a ""force majeure event"".

 

Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties.

 

Boeing historically sent a quarter of its deliveries to China but the proportion has been falling following earlier trade tensions, a 737 MAX safety crisis and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

Analysts said a short-term halt in deliveries to China would not have an immediate major impact on Boeing, since it could serve other airlines and Airbus lacks spare capacity.

 

In the longer term, China remains a strategic market. Boeing says China will more than double its fleet by 2043, with the country set to overtake the US in terms of air traffic.

 

Boeing data shows 130 unfilled orders for China-based airlines and lessors, including 96 of the 737 MAX. Industry sources say a significant portion of the more than 760 unfilled orders for which Boeing has yet to name a buyer are for China.

 

Chinese airlines lease 55% of their jets and it is ""highly probable"" they will try to extend any expiring leases for the time being, IBA Chief Economist Stuart Hatcher said.

 Trump signals tit-for-tat China tariffs may be near end; TikTok deal on ice ,"
                        
                        
                        US President Donald Trump on Thursday signalled a potential end to the tit-for-tat tariff hikes between the US and China that shocked markets, and that a deal over the fate of social media platform TikTok may have to wait.

""I don't want them to go higher because at a certain point you make it where people don't buy,"" Trump told reporters about tariffs at the White House.

""So, I may not want to go higher or I may not want to even go up to that level. I may want to go to less because you know you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy.""

Trump's comments further pointed to a diminished appetite for sharply higher across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries after markets reacted violently to their introduction on Apr 2.

The Republican president slapped 10% tariffs on most goods entering the country but delayed the implementation of higher levies, pending negotiations.

Still, he hiked rates on Chinese imports, now totalling 145%, after Beijing retaliated with its own counter-measures. Last week, China said ""will not respond"" to a ""numbers game with tariffs,"" its own signal that across-the-board rates would not rise further.

Trump said China had been in touch since the imposition of tariffs and expressed optimism that they could reach a deal.

While the two sides are in touch, sources told Reuters that free-flowing, high-level exchanges of the sorts that would lead to a deal have largely been absent.

Speaking with reporters, Trump repeatedly declined to specify the nature of talks between the countries or whether they directly included Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump has repeatedly extended a legal deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the US assets of the short video app used by 170 million Americans. On Thursday, he said a spin-off deal would likely wait until the trade issue is settled.

""We have a deal for TikTok, but it'll be subject to China so we'll just delay the deal 'til this thing works out one way or the other,"" Trump said.

Peters noted that the entertainment sector, and Netflix specifically, had proven resilient during previous downturns in the economy. ""We really do expect the demand to remain strong,"" he said.

He added that the company's lower-cost options also should help. The ad-supported tier accounted for 55% of new sign-ups in countries where it is available, the company has said.

                        Netflix executives on Thursday backed the company's revenue outlook for the year and voiced confidence that the streaming service would weather any economic turbulence from President Donald Trump's erratic tariff plans. Following an earnings report that topped analyst expectations, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said the company had not seen any significant shifts in customer behaviour, commentary that is likely to ease Wall Street concerns that Trump's policies would prompt lately frugal consumers to reconsider spending on streaming services.

Netflix shares rose 2.7% in after-hours trading. The stock has risen 9% so far this year, compared with a 10% slump in the broader S&P 500 index.

With more than 300 million global customers, Netflix has continued to sign up subscribers in markets around the world as consumers flocked to its lower-priced, ad-supported tier since its launch in late 2022.

Peters noted that the entertainment sector, and Netflix specifically, had proven resilient during previous downturns in the economy. ""We really do expect the demand to remain strong,"" he said.

He added that the company's lower-cost options also should help. The ad-supported tier accounted for 55% of new sign-ups in countries where it is available, the company has said.

 Japanese finance minister to attend trade talks with US over increased export tariffs ,"
                        
                        
                        Japan is ""deeply concerned"" about global economic fallout from US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Thursday in the government's strongest warning yet as the two nations began trade talks.

In an interview with Reuters in Tokyo hours after the talks began in Washington, Kato also voiced concern over recent volatile market moves triggered by Trump's tariff announcements, saying they could hurt Japan's economic recovery.

""The recent US tariff measures affect various industries and heighten uncertainty. We're deeply concerned they could affect Japan's economy, as well as the global economy, through various routes such as trade and financial markets,"" said Kato, who plans to go to Washington next week for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 20.

Kato is also expected to meet separately with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to continue the talks begun by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa. Trump unexpectedly joined those talks, which included Bessent.

""There's a risk of exerting downward pressure on Japan's economy,"" Kato said of the US tariffs and the ensuing market volatility, in his first media interview since Trump announced ""reciprocal"" tariffs on many nations on Apr 2.

Kato said he will ""closely communicate"" with the US on currency issues, adding Tokyo and Washington have long agreed that excessive volatility and disorderly moves in currency rates are undesirable.

""It's important for currency rates to move stably, reflecting fundamentals. There's no change to the government's concern over currency market developments, including speculative moves,"" he said. ""We need to scrutinise how the US tariff measures affect financial market moves, including currency rates.""

NO WORD ON YEN DISCUSSIONS

Kato declined to comment on how any discussions on currencies could unfold once he meets Bessent, saying that doing so now would be premature and cause undue speculation in the market.

""The only thing I can say is that we will actively exchange views based on Japan's basic stance"" on currencies, Kato said, when asked about market speculation that Washington could ask Japan to join a coordinated effort to weaken the dollar.

Trump has indicated he wants the trade talks to include his accusations that Japan intentionally weakens the yen to help its exporters and his complaints that Japan does not pay enough to support US troops based in the country. Japan, which denies manipulating its currency, wants to avoid such topics.

Trade negotiator Akazawa, Japan's economic revitalisation minister, said exchange rates did not come up in Wednesday's talks, adding that both sides deferred to an earlier agreement between their leaders that currency matters would be set aside for talks between their finance chiefs.

Akazawa also brushed aside the idea that Washington might seek a coordinated effort to weaken the dollar.

""As it has done in the past, Japan's government could take action in the market if there are speculative moves but it won't do anything beyond that,"" Akazawa told reporters in Washington after the talks. ""Japan isn't manipulating the market to weaken the yen in the first place.""

The policy chief of Ishiba's ruling party, Itsunori Onodera, said on Sunday that Japan must strengthen the yen, such as by helping boost the country's industrial competitiveness, to fight inflation.

US MIGHT TARGET BOJ

But even as politicians talk up the yen, the Trump administration could target the Bank of Japan over the currency's weakness, some analysts say.

For more than a decade, the BOJ pursued a radical monetary easing to fight entrenched deflation, even as other big central banks raised interest rates, driving the yen to near three-decade lows against the dollar. And while the BOJ has begun raising rates, it is moving slowly and rates remain extremely low.

Kato stressed that monetary policy decisions fall under the jurisdiction of the BOJ but said the government will deepen dialogue with the central bank on the economy, including the impact of US tariffs.

""There is no change to our expectations the BOJ would guide monetary policy appropriately to achieve its 2 percent inflation target in a stable and durable manner,"" he said.

Some Japanese lawmakers and policymakers have said Japan's heavy reliance on global free trade heightens the need to convince the US that tariffs are counterproductive, and reach out to other countries for policy coordination.

In the bilateral trade negotiations, Japan should explain how it can help the US resuscitate its ailing manufacturing sector and narrow the huge US trade deficit, Kato said.

He countered the view that Trump's protectionist policies could create dysfunction in multilateral cooperation, in which the US plays a crucial role.

""Obviously, any country would put its interest first. But countries have made efforts to iron out their differences,"" Kato said. ""Each country has its own situation and views. But it's our job as policymakers to seek a better approach that eventually benefits the US, Japan, and the global economy.""

                        The trading and indices at the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) have seen a sharp decline over the past four days.
On Thursday, the DSEX fell by 8 points, down from 5,105 points.
In the first hour of transactions, the market gained 20 points, but it sustained a mixed trend as the day progressed, ending at 5,097 due to selling pressure at the close.
The DSEX index last went up on Apr 10 when it registered 5,205 points. The indice has continuously declined since then, producing an overall drop in the price index after mixed-trend transactions throughout the days.
Alongside the broad index, the throughput also fell as the DSE, the largest capital market in the country, had seen share transfers worth Tk 5.4 billion on Apr 10 before it shrunk to Tk 4.14 billion on Apr 13.
The capital market was closed on Monday due to the Bengali New Year celebrations. On Tuesday, shares worth Tk 4.46 billion changed hands, while it was Tk 4.96 billion on Wednesday.
The latest transaction was recorded at Tk 3.39 billion on Thursday, On Mar 27, during Ramadan, the DSE saw turnovers worth Tk 3.15 billion.

" Trump's trade war ripples through the business world, hits stocks again ","
                        
                        
                        The ripple effects of Donald Trump's global trade war are increasingly being felt across numerous industries all at once and on Wednesday were once again exerting pressure on US stock markets that have been roiled for weeks by his erratic trade policies.

 

Stocks fell broadly, with tech stocks hit particularly hard after bellwethers like Nvidia that are highly tied into the world's supply chain warned of hits to their bottom line.

 

Meanwhile, airlines said they are bracing for an uncertain summer travel season, and the head of the Federal Reserve noted slowing economic activity - but also cast a wary eye on the threat that tariffs pose to its goal of lowering inflation.

 

And though Trump has said numerous countries are lining up to make deals with the United States, the progress has been slow and uncertain. The president was set to engage personally in talks with Japan over tariffs later on Wednesday.

 

While the market volatility that erupted two weeks ago has ebbed, business leaders still say the uncertainty is stalling spending plans. The world's two largest economies - the United States and China - remain in a full-blown trade war, and the status of US talks with the European Union, Canada and other countries is unclear.

 

""What was true yesterday is no longer true today, what will be tomorrow I do not know,"" said Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of Rome-based Bulgari, the jewellery subsidiary of luxury giant LVMH LVMH.PA, regarding US tariff policy.

 

TECH SELL OFF

 

Tech companies were at the forefront of Wednesday's ructions. AI chip giant Nvidia said its sales to China would cost it $5.5 billion in accounting charges due to the administration's curbs on AI chip exports, while ASML, the world's biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment, said tariffs have made the outlook for both 2025 and 2026 uncertain. Other US chip equipment makers could see a hit of about $1 billion yearly due to the levies, industry officials told lawmakers last week.

 

Stocks overall slid again on Wednesday, with the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite falling 3%, led by a 7% drop in Nvidia Fellow chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices said it would take a $800 million hit from the administration's curbs on sales to China.

 

Even more optimistic companies tempered their positivity. United Airlines UAL.O maintained its profit outlook for 2025, but unusually, laid out two scenarios for the year, saying that the macro environment was ""impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence.""

 

Japan, the nation currently at the front of the queue in talks, was thrust into the position of having scheduled talks between economic revitalisation minister Ryosei Akazawa and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent turn into a meeting with Trump himself on Wednesday evening. The US president said he would attend the discussions personally to cover other non-trade issues as he continues to focus on the US balance of trade with other countries.

 

Japan exports more than 1 million cars to the US every year, particularly affordable models that could see their price tag rise by thousands of dollars if tariffs stay in place. Some automakers have broached moving some production to the US, but that is not an easy task.

 

""We need to have somewhat of a break on the tariffs for a period of time so that we can organize ourselves to localize ...and bring the supplier base in the US,"" Nissan Americas 7201.T chairman Christian Meunier told Reuters, adding that the process takes years.

 

SCRAMBLING TO GET THINGS IN

 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in a speech in Chicago, noted the slowing economy but added that ""inflation is likely to go up as tariffs find their way and some part of those tariffs come to be paid by the public.""

 

US consumer sentiment has deteriorated sharply since Trump ratcheted up the rhetoric around tariffs in mid-February.

 

Banking CEOs in recent days have said consumer spending has not dipped dramatically, but cracks are starting to appear. Retail sales were robust in March, largely due to the best month for auto sales since 2023, but other components in spending were softer, and service-sector spending could start to ebb as people load up on goods, worried about higher prices.

 

Retailers are aware of this possibility as well, as China-based discount retailers Temu and Shein encouraged shoppers to buy ""now at today's rates,"" saying in nearly identical letters that they would be raising prices beginning Apr 25.

 

Spending on goods and equipment - both to and from the United States - could also face a bumpier path.

 

""Everybody was scrambling through the month of March to try to get things in,"" said Marko Bebek, a sales manager for LB White, which makes hog barn equipment in the US that is sold in Canada.

 Chinese factory bids to keep exporting fun amid US trade war ,"
                        
                        
                        Bin Zhang is in the business of fun, but his job has become less so because of US President Donald Trump.

 

Zhang, 36, whose company, iFun, has customers all over the world and gets orders ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 for his products - everything that's needed to set up an arcade, play area for kids in a shopping mall or for a trampoline park.

 

Until recently, a fifth of sales from Zhang's company, iFun, which has a factory in China‚Äôs southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou, went to the United States.

 

But Trump‚Äôs extra tariffs this year of 145% on imports from China have forced Zhang‚Äôs US customers to put orders on hold.

 

iFun is one of more than 30,000 exhibitors at the Canton Fair in Guangzhou, China's largest trade fair, which will run through May 5.

 

Still, Zhang is hopeful, like many business owners in Guangzhou, which has been dubbed the factory of the world, that Trump will roll back the tariffs before the pain really hits China.

 

If that doesn‚Äôt happen, Zhang is confident of doubling his $17-million business in the next five years and selling in other markets.

 

‚ÄúWe can move our time and energy to other markets, like maybe Mexico, Canada or South America,‚Äù he said in an interview at his factory, painted in vivid tones of green, yellow and red.

 

Inside the factory larger than a football field, 150 workers assemble colourful vinyl-covered boxes that will be turned into a connected set of toddler-sized buildings and slides. Ice cream machines, popcorn makers and astronaut statues await shipment.

 

In another area, workers test a long line of arcade games: air hockey, arcade basketball and a shooter game where imaginary US forces are preparing to open fire on robots with a ""satellite laser canon.""

 

One box nearby reads: ""Super Time Machine: Made in China.""

 

""It‚Äôs just for fun,"" Zhang says.

 

Nowhere outside southern China is Zhang able to access the dense supply chain he relies on to fill his orders. About 90% of the materials he needs are within a few hours' drive.

 

He plans to build another factory in the southern region of Guangdong and does not believe an offshore location, even with tariff savings, would match the speed of his China operations.

 

Like many Chinese entrepreneurs, Zhang has something between a conviction and a hope that Trump will blink on tariffs.

 

""Our people have talked with many customers from the US, There‚Äôs always this thinking,"" Zhang said. ""Maybe today he puts (on) such high tariffs, maybe tomorrow he will cancel.""

                        US stocks ended sharply lower on Wednesday as Nvidia warned about steep charges from new US curbs on its chip exports to China and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said US economic growth appears to be slowing.

 

Powell, in remarks for the Economic Club of Chicago, said larger-than-expected tariffs likely mean higher inflation and slower growth. But he said the Fed would wait for more data on the economy's direction before making any changes to interest rates.

 

The Fed chair's afternoon comments sparked further selling in stocks, which had already been under pressure from a sharp drop in shares of Nvidia and other chipmakers.

 

""Powell is confirming what investors have been worried about, and that is the likelihood of slowing economic growth and more stubborn inflation as a result of the tariffs,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.

 

Nvidia said late on Tuesday it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the US government limited exports of its H20 artificial-intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.

 

It was among the latest developments in the US-China trade fight. China raised its tariffs on imports of US goods to 125% on Friday in a retaliatory move after US President Donald Trump effectively raised US tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%.

 

""The markets and investors want certainty and of this much I am certain: this year will be a more difficult year for investors than the last two cake walks,"" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group in Boston.

The Nasdaq had fallen as low as 16,066.46 during the session.

 

At the same time, Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility index rose, ending the day at 32.64.

 

Nvidia shares fell 6.9% on the day, while an index of semiconductor stocks dropped 4.1%. The new US curbs also affected AMD, whose shares fell 7.3%.

 

Also on Wednesday, Dutch chip-making tools giant ASML warned that the tariffs had led to increased uncertainty about its outlook.

 

""Markets continue to digest tariff implementation details that remain fluid, and as a result investors', businesses' and consumer uncertainty just remains incredibly high,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at US Bank Wealth Management in Billings, Montana.

 New entrepreneurs will 'fall behind' as uneven gas rates threaten industry competition ,"
                        
                        
                        Many entrepreneurs and business owners view the interim government's decision to set separate gas prices for new and old industrial customers as ‚Äúdouble standards‚Äù.
They argue that raising gas prices by 33 percent for new consumers while keeping lower rates for older ones, not only undermines competitiveness but also risks triggering inflation and discouraging fresh investment.
Terming the decision ‚Äúunjustified‚Äù and ‚Äúwithout precedent‚Äù, critics fear the move will create an uneven playing field in the industrial sector, dampening the enthusiasm of aspiring entrepreneurs.
The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) announced a 33 percent hike in the gas price per cubic foot for new industries and captive power plants on Sunday.
According to the BERC's decision, the price of gas used for power generation (captive) has risen from Tk 31.50 to Tk 42. 
The gas prices for new industrial connections have been set at Tk 40, up from Tk 30.
It says industries approved after Apr 13 will have to pay the increased rates for gas while existing consumers will continue to buy gas at the old rates for up to 50 percent of their load; the rest will be purchased at the new higher rates.


The government has justified this price hike as part of efforts to reduce subsidies.
Zahid Hussain, former chief economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office, sees no logic in setting separate prices for ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúold‚Äù customers as a method of subsidy reduction.
Speaking to bdnews24.com, he said: ""Even under a microscope, you won't find an explanation for this in the economy; it simply doesn't have one. 
‚ÄúIt, however, can be understood from a political-economic standpoint.""
The economist pointed to a possible reason. ‚ÄúLarge, long-standing businesses were vocal during the public hearing on gas price hikes. The government perhaps didn‚Äôt want to provoke them, so it spared them. 
‚ÄúWithout raising prices and cutting subsidies, the next [International Monetary Fund] loan tranche might have been in jeopardy,‚Äù he added.
bdnews24.com sent a message to Energy Advisor Fouzul Kabir Khan, asking whether the two-tier pricing would cause discrimination and obstruct investment, but received no reply.
Explaining the reason for the price hike to German-based media Deutsche Welle, Fouzul said: ""This will not hinder investment; rather, it will strengthen investment.""
‚ÄúWe have to remember, our gas reserves are depleting,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúTo meet the gap, we are importing LNG at Tk 70 per cubic metre. If we‚Äôre supplying gas at Tk 30, we‚Äôre giving a subsidy of Tk 40. 
‚ÄúHow long can we afford that?‚Äù the advisor asked.


Economist Zahid agrees that the price hike might not directly discourage new investors, as gas prices alone are not the sole factor determining investment decisions.
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the only parameter influencing investment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf other facilities are in place, investors might be able to adjust. 
‚ÄúBut the disparity created between old and new consumers‚Äîthere‚Äôs no justification for that.‚Äù
He added, ‚ÄúThe gas price hike should arguably affect the older players more than the new ones.
‚ÄúThe older companies have a greater capacity to absorb pressure. They can also speak out.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúBut the new ones? They have no representation. Who will speak up for them?‚Äù
Some have interpreted the price hike as part of a broader attempt to phase out subsidies in the energy sector.
Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and managing director of Bangladesh Apparel Exchange, believes uninterrupted gas supply is the more critical issue.
 ‚ÄúIf gas is supplied reliably, costs in captive power generation will drop, allowing for adjustment,‚Äù he told bdnews24.com.
‚ÄúBut the government‚Äôs message is that, for now, only new consumers will pay more ‚Äî the older ones will follow. Perhaps the government plans to eliminate all subsidies.‚Äù
The Foreign Investors‚Äô Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), an organisation representing foreign investors in Bangladesh, fears that prices for older consumers may also rise once their contracts are up for renewal.


In a media statement on Tuesday, the organisation described the two-tier pricing as ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù. 
‚ÄúSeparate gas tariffs have been set for new consumers, committed consumers, and existing consumers ‚Äî this is entirely unacceptable,‚Äù the statement reads.

 ‚ÄúThese price structures will severely hinder new investment and industrial expansion. Such dual pricing not only violates the principle of fair competition but also undermines equal opportunity in a competitive market,‚Äù it added.
To attract foreign investment, the Muhammad Yunus-led government hosted a major investment summit last week with investors from 50 countries.
At the event, Bangladesh Bank announced the creation of a special Tk 9 billion fund for new entrepreneurs.
Critics are calling out the contradiction: inviting investment on the one hand while creating barriers through higher energy costs on the other. 
‚ÄúAt a time when the government is taking multiple steps to attract investment, imposing higher gas prices on only new industries and investors is a contradictory approach,‚Äù said the FICCI.
This policy shift also coincides with a slump in private-sector investment.
According to the central bank, private sector credit growth dropped to 6.82 percent in February‚Äîthe lowest in over a decade.
Analysts noted that in the Ease of Doing Business index, greater emphasis is placed on offering opportunities to new entrants, including uninterrupted access to energy.
Humayra Ferdous, a specialist in local industrial development and sustainable technology, said the gas hike would push back new entrepreneurs and hamper the emergence of new industries. 
‚ÄúAs a result, import dependency will increase,‚Äù she warned.
The American International University‚ÄìBangladesh (AIUB) professor told bdnews24.com: ‚ÄúEase of Doing Business means ensuring easy access to energy and other services. 
‚ÄúRaising gas prices for new businesses means they won‚Äôt be able to compete with established players. The advantage will go to the bigger ones.‚Äù
She explained that older and larger industrial enterprises are more capable of absorbing the cost burden ‚Äî new ones are not.
Humayra said: ‚ÄúThe government could have increased corporate tax rates for large industrial groups to raise revenue. They‚Äôre already established ‚Äî it‚Äôs time they shared some benefits with the state,‚Äù Humayra said.
‚ÄúBut if energy costs are raised, new companies simply won‚Äôt emerge. Then how will employment be generated? Everything would have to be imported,‚Äù she concluded.

" Government priotises gas supply to export-oriented, EPZ factories ","
                        
                        
                        The interim government has decided to resume gas connections for industries after a prolonged suspension caused by supply shortages.


Priority will be given to export-oriented factories and those located in export processing zones (EPZs).


The Energy and Mineral Resources Division conveyed the decision to Petrobangla on Wednesday, according to officials.


Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Advisor Fouzul Kabir Khan said instructions have been issued to ensure proper gas supply to newly connected industrial units.


He said the move came after the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) revised gas prices. 


‚ÄúGas connections will be given to export-oriented industries and factories in EPZs on a priority basis,‚Äù he added.


New gas connections for industrial units had been suspended for a long time due to the ongoing energy crisis. 


Even existing factories were struggling to receive their required supply. 


The interim government‚Äôs decision is being viewed as a positive step in the current circumstances.


Md Rafiqul Islam, director of operations at Petrobangla, told bdnews24.com that several long-pending applications remain with different distribution companies. 


‚ÄúThe matter of connecting export-oriented industrial units has been under discussion for some time. Now a positive decision has come from the government side,‚Äù he said.


The BERC on Sunday raised gas prices by 33 percent for new industries and for captive power generation at industrial units.


Under the new pricing, gas used for captive power generation has increased from Tk 31.50 to Tk 42 per cubic foot. 


For new industrial connections, the gas price has been set at Tk 40, up from Tk 30.


According to the BERC, industries receiving approval after Apr 13 will have to purchase gas at the new rates. 


In contrast, committed customers ‚Äì those who have already received demand notes ‚Äì will receive 50 percent of their approved load at the previous rate. 


The remainder must be purchased at the new rate.


The revised prices will be applicable from the current month‚Äôs bill.

" Government lifts advance tax on unrefined soyabean, palm oil imports ","
                        
                        
                        The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has withdrawn the 5 percent advance tax on imports of unrefined soyabean and palm oil, just a day after cooking oil prices were hiked by Tk 14 per litre following traders‚Äô demands.

The tax exemption was announced through a special order issued on Tuesday and made public on Wednesday.

The directive, signed by NBR‚Äôs First Secretary (VAT Policy) Md Moshiur Rahman, clarified that the exemption applies specifically to the import of crude soyabean and palm oil, which had previously been subjected to a 5 percent advance tax.

On Tuesday, the interim government set the new price of bottled soyabean oil at Tk 189 per litre while loose soyabean oil was priced at Tk 169 per litre.

The price of bottled soyabean was last revised on Dec 9, 2024, when it was set at Tk 175 per litre.

On Sunday, Bashir Uddin said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve revised the prices of soybean oil based on the international market and [Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission] formula.‚Äù

‚ÄúAccording to the formula, each litre of [soyabean] oil costs Tk 197. But we set the price after discussing it with industry stakeholders.‚Äù

Citing the withdrawal of tax exemption benefits as the reason for the price hike, the advisor said, ""The government exempted tax for cooking oil. This caused a Tk 5.5 billion drop in revenue collection per month.""

‚ÄúWe have limitations in granting revenue exemptions to meet operating expenses of the government. A tax exemption of about Tk 20 billion was granted with Ramadan in mind. The tax exemption for soyabean oil has been withdrawn for now.""

The government's decision to cut cooking oil excise duty before Ramadan to keep the prices affordable expired on Mar 31. Mill owners proposed raising prices before that, suggesting a Tk 18 hike for bottled and Tk 13 for loose soyabean oil.

Earlier, on Oct 17, 2024, the NBR exempted 15 percent VAT at the production stage and 5 percent at trading for both refined and unrefined soyabean and palm oil supply.

On Apr 1, the day after the VAT exemption expired, traders announced bringing the proposed price hike into effect.

Bangladesh Vegetable Oil Refiners and Vanaspati Manufacturers Association sent a letter to the commerce ministry and the tariff commission on Mar 27 informing them of the decision.

Discussions between the government and traders resumed after the Eid-ul-Fitr holidays, leading to Tuesday‚Äôs revised pricing that aligned closely with the traders‚Äô proposals.

" Salman, Shayan, Shibli face embezzlement charges in IFIC Aamar bond ‚Äòfraud‚Äô ","
                        
                        
                        The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) is preparing to initiate an embezzlement case against former IFIC Bank chairman Salman F Rahman, his son Shayan F Rahman, former BSEC chairman Shibli Rubayat Ul Islam, and 27 others on charges of ‚Äúfraud‚Äù over IFIC Aamar Bond.

ACC Director General Akhtar Hossain said on Wednesday that the case will be filed by Assistant Director Sajjad Hossain, and it has already been greenlit by the anti-graft agency.

The accused allegedly misappropriated Tk 10 billion from the market.

Real estate company Sreepur Township issued bonds with good dividends in 2023, claiming to raise funds for a large housing project in Gazipur. They raised Tk 10 billion from the market by selling the bonds, called ‚ÄúIFIC Aamar Bond‚Äù.

Despite what the name suggests, the bond is not IFIC‚Äôs. The bank is simply the guarantor of the bond, though the promotional campaign made it seem that it was issued by the bank.

Deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina‚Äôs advisor and Beximco Group Chairman Salman and Shayan are stakeholders of the company, also shareholders of IFIC bank, raising questions about conflict of interest over issuing the bond.

Although Sreepur Township, established in March 2023, had no previous experience in flat construction or plot management, IFIC chose to be the guarantor of its bond.

In other words, Sreepur Township was given a guarantee to withdraw money using the good reputation of IFIC Bank.

The name of IFIC Bank was written prominently in newspaper promotions, while Sreepur Township was mentioned in small letters, which was a fraud on the investors.

According to ACC findings, the actual value of the land shown as security for the bond was Tk 870 million, but it was shown as Tk 10.2 billion.

Of the money withdrawn from the market, Tk 2 billion was converted into fixed deposits (FDR) and paid to the investors as interest. The remaining Tk 8 billion was transferred to the accounts of different companies owned by Salman, including Beximco Engineering Limited.

According to the ACC, suspicious transactions and cash withdrawals were made from these accounts for ‚Äúembezzlement and laundering‚Äù.

ACC alleges that the accused colluded for offences like ""conspiracy, abuse of power, fraud and deceit"". They issued bonds on the basis of ‚Äúovervaluation‚Äù without collecting CIB reports and without properly verifying the mortgaged property. Since the money ultimately belonged to the government and the people, it was a ‚Äúcrime punishable under the laws related to ‚Äúembezzlement and money laundering‚Äù.
Apart from the three, the ACC plans to accuse Sreepur Township Managing Director Md Mashiuzzaman, Director Tilat Shahrin, former managing director of IFIC Bank Md Shah Alam Sarwar, and former independent director Sudhangshu Shekhar Biswas, ARM Nazmus Sakib, Quamrun Nahar Ahmed, Rabeya Jamali, Golam Mostofa and Md Zafar Iqbal in the case.
Besides, former Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) commissioner Rumana Islam, Mizanur Rahman, Shaikh Shamsuddin Ahmed and Md Abdul Halim will also be named as accused, according to the ACC.
IFIC Bank's Deputy Managing Director and Chief Credit Officer Syed Mansur Mustafa, Head of Loan Performance Management Shah Md Moinuddin, Chief Business Officer (Retail) Md Rafiqul Islam, Chief Business Officer (Corporate) Gitanka D Datta, Chief of IT Md Nurul Hasnat, Chief Information Officer Monitur Rahman and Head of Treasury Mohammad Sahin Uddin also face charges.
Alongside them, former manager and FVP of the Dhanmondi branch Nazimul Haque, former manager Hossain Shah Ali, Relationships Manager Sardar Mominul Islam, Sandhani Life Insurance Company Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Nimai Kumar Saha, Company Secretary Md. Mizanur Rahman, former branch anti-money laundering compliance officers of IFIC Bank Ayesha Siddika and Sylvia Chowdhury face charges as well.
They face charges under Sections 409/420/467/468/471/477(a)/109 of the Penal Code, Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, and Section 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2012.
The ACC said these people had raised Tk 10 billion from these investors in the name of Sreepur Township, which was ‚Äúfreshly registered and under inexperienced ownership‚Äù.

                        Commerce Advisor Sheikh Bashir Uddin has said a team will visit the United States next week to discuss tariffs levied on Bangladeshi products, which the Trump administration says was a move to reduce the bilateral trade deficit.
The trade deficit stands at $6 billion between the countries, meaning, Bangladesh ships goods worth $6 billion more to the US than what the country sends over.
On Wednesday, Bashir Uddin said the United States only takes into account goods, not services, in calculating the deficit, he added.
Bangladesh‚Äôs exports to the US are worth $8 billion while imports are goods worth $2 billion, he said and added: ‚ÄúThe trade deficit calculation is becoming conceptual.‚Äù
""The whole trade deficit debate is becoming speculative. We‚Äôve prepared several action plans with the advice of the country's eminent economists to determine how we can reduce the trade deficit with the US.""
‚ÄúChief Advisor‚Äôs Special Envoy Lutfey Siddiqi and the commerce secretary are scheduled to visit the US next week. They will be connected to the Office of the US Trade Representative there,‚Äù he added.
He said 75 percent of Bangladesh imports are either cotton, liquified natural gas (LNG), soyabean, or metal scraps.
Trump‚Äôs new tariffs on goods from over 100 countries will impose a 37 percent supplementary tariff on Bangladeshi exports, increasing the total tariff to 52 percent, up from the previous 15 percent.
Traders fear that the imposition of the tariff could reduce Bangladesh's export capability to the US, the country's main export market.
However, the Trump administration has suspended the imposition of additional tariffs for 90 days following a request from the chief advisor.

""The credit cards we use, Google, Facebook, the international banking system, these are the services of the United States. They do not take into account the export of these services.""

Bashir Uddin said the issues would be raised in the top-level discussion ahead between the two countries, underlining the trade deficit as an important issue for Bangladesh as the US is the single largest buyer of the country‚Äôs export goods.

" Shares fall in Asia as Nvidia curbs fan worries, gold hits record ","
                        
                        
                        Shares fell in Asia on Wednesday as AI darling Nvidia took a hit from US curbs on chip sales to China, highlighting the damage to come in a tit-for-tat global trade war, while gold hit a record and the dollar stayed under pressure.
Data showed that China's economy grew 5.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, beating expectations, although trade tensions with the US have clouded the outlook.
Overnight, President Donald Trump ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on all US critical minerals imports, on top of reviews into pharmaceutical and chip imports. Beijing is continuing to play hardball, having reportedly ordered airlines to suspend deliveries of Boeing aircraft.
Treasury yields were steady ahead of a key speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later in the day. Fed Governor Christopher Waller already sounded dovish and the expectation is Powell will echo the recent messages from his colleagues amid the tariff chaos.
S&P 500 futures fell 0.8 percent while Nasdaq futures slumped 1.4 percent. That was due to a 6 percent plunge in Nvidia shares in after-hours trading, which erased a total of $160 billion in its market cap.
The chip giant is facing $5.5 billion in charges after the US government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.
""This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China,"" said Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities.
""The Street will take this news with clear nervousness, worried these are the first shots fired in the tech battle between the US and China and Beijing/Xi are not just going to take this news and walk away.""
On Wednesday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent, snapping a four-day winning streak. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.5 percent.
Chinese blue chips fell 0.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 1.6 percent. Chinese semiconductor shares, however, rallied with Hua Hong Semi up 4 percent and SMIC 1 percent higher.
""Both countries seem to believe they have the upper hand, potentially prolonging the current stalemate for months to come,"" said analysts at PGIM Fixed Income in a note to clients.
""China appears to have no intention of climbing down from its current stance on tariffs and instead views the current trade dynamics as an opportunity to make inroads with countries that export to the US.""
The White House said Trump is open to making a trade deal with China but Beijing should make the first move.
GOLD SHINES
All of the uncertainties left gold in an unstoppable position, with the bullion up 1.2 percent to hit another record high of $3,266.65 per ounce.
ANZ on Wednesday updated their forecast for gold to hit $3,600 an ounce by the year-end, arguing that the risk-off purchases for the asset are yet to pick up.
US Treasuries found some love after an epic sell-off last week, helped in part by Trump's tariff reversals.
The benchmark 10-year yield was steady at 4.325 percent, well off the recent high of 4.592 percent. The 30-year yield was little changed at 4.777 percent, also some 25 basis points lower from the high seen last week.
In the currency markets, the dollar was on the back foot again, with the euro up 0.3 percent to $1.1316 and the yen 0.3 percent higher at 142.84 per dollar.
Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda told the Sankei newspaper that the central bank may need to take policy action if US tariffs hurt the Japanese economy, signalling the potential to pause the bank's rate-hike cycle.
Oil prices were marginally higher. Brent inched up 0.2 percent at $64.79 a barrel, while US crude also rose 0.2 percent to $61.42 per barrel.

 Nvidia faces $5.5 billion charge as US restricts chip sales to China ,"
                        
                        
                        Nvidia on Tuesday said it would take $5.5 billion in charges after the US government limited exports of its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a key market for one of its most popular chips.

 

Nvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of US export controls as US officials have moved to keep the most advanced chips from being sold to China as the US tries to keep ahead in the AI race. After those controls were implemented, Nvidia began designing chips that would come as close as possible to US limits.

 

Nvidia shares were down about 6% in after-hours trading.

 

A US Commerce Department spokesperson said late on Tuesday that it was issuing new licensing requirements for exports of chips including Nvidia's H20, AMD's MI308 and their equivalents.

 

""The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security,"" said the spokesperson of the department that oversees US export controls.

 

AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its shares were down 7% in after-hours trading.

 

For Nvidia, the H20 is its most advanced chip available for sale in China and is central to its efforts to stay engaged with China's booming AI industry. Chinese companies including Tencent 0700.HK, Alibaba 9988.HK and TikTok parent ByteDance had been ramping up orders for H20 chips due to booming demand for low-cost AI models from startup DeepSeek, Reuters reported in February.

 

While the H20 chip is not as fast at training AI models as Nvidia's chips for sale outside China, it is competitive with some of those chips at a step known as inference, where AI models serve up answers to users. Inference is fast becoming the biggest part of the AI chip market. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month argued that Nvidia is well positioned to dominate that shift.

 

But Nvidia said on Tuesday that the US government was restricting H20 sales to China because of the risk the chips could be used in a supercomputer. While the H20 has lower computing capabilities than other Nvidia chips, its ability to connect to memory chips and other computing chips at high speeds is still high.

 

Those memory and connectivity aspects could make the H20 useful in building supercomputers in China, and the US has placed restrictions on selling chips for use in supercomputers in China since 2022. The Institute for Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday argued for restricting H20 chips, writing that Chinese firms were likely already building such systems.

 

""At least one of the buyers, Tencent, has already installed H20s in a facility used to train a large model, very likely in breach of existing controls restricting the usage of chips in supercomputers exceeding certain thresholds. DeepSeek‚Äôs supercomputer used to train their V3 model is also likely in breach of the same restrictions,"" the group wrote.

 

Nvidia said on Tuesday that the US government informed it on April 9 that the H20 chip would require a license to be exported to China and on April 14 it told Nvidia those rules would be in place indefinitely.

 

It is unclear how many, if any, of those licenses the US government might grant.

 

Nvidia declined to comment beyond its filing.

 

The $5.5 billion in charges are associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves, Nvidia said.

 

The news comes after Nvidia said on Monday it was planning to build AI servers worth as much as $500 billion in the US over the next four years with help from partners such as TSMC, in step with the Trump administration's push for local manufacturing.

                        US stocks ended slightly lower on Tuesday as tariff uncertainty stayed high and shares of consumer and healthcare companies eased, while upbeat results from banks provided some support.

Shares of Bank of America and Citigroup rose following their results.

Still, bank executives warned that US consumer spending faces huge risks if the upheaval sparked by President Donald Trump's trade policy goes on.

Among the biggest weights on the Dow was Boeing. The stock fell 2.4% after Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that China has ordered its airlines not to take further deliveries of Boeing jets in response to the US decision to impose 145% tariffs on Chinese goods.

Federal Register filings on Monday showed the Trump administration was also proceeding with probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, as part of a bid to impose tariffs on the sectors.

Trump's April 2 announcement of sweeping tariffs sparked turmoil in the market and fueled worries about a global trade war and possible recession. Trading has been more subdued this week, but investors have been unable to focus on much else.

""Earnings have been pretty good, but this is a market that's just beset by tariff and trade uncertainty and those are really the only catalysts that matter at this point,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.

""On a day where you're bereft of those (catalysts), it's kind of a wayward market, and we're seeing that today.""

Johnson & Johnson's shares ended down 0.5% after the company missed estimates for sales of medical devices, despite beating Wall Street estimates for first-quarter revenue and profit.

Barclays on Tuesday downgraded the US auto and mobility sector, saying Trump's tariffs could pressure automakers' earnings. Shares of Ford closed down 2.7% while shares of General Motors fell 1.3% and the S&P consumer discretionary index slipped 0.8%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 155.83 points, or 0.38%, to 40,368.96, the S&P 500 lost 9.34 points, or 0.17%, to 5,396.63 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 8.32 points, or 0.05%, to 16,823.17.

Also in the healthcare space, shares of Merck & Co ended 1% lower.

Bank of America topped estimates for first-quarter profit as interest income grew, and its shares ended up 3.6%.

S&P 500 companies have just begun to report results for the quarter ended March 31, but changes in US trade policy are muddying the outlook and executives could be reluctant to give earnings guidance.

""As far as the results from Q1, those basically occurred in a world that doesn't really exist anymore,"" Mayfield said. ""It's going to be about guidance, and I expect a lot of companies to just kind of punt and rescind their guidance.""

Johnson & Johnson's chief executive said that tariffs on pharmaceuticals can create supply-chain disruptions and that favorable tax policies would be a more effective tool to boost US manufacturing capacity of both drugs and medical devices.

Strategists also are paying close attention to their technical charts after the S&P 500's 50-day moving average slipped below the 200-DMA on Monday, producing a ""death cross"" pattern that suggests a short-term correction could turn in to a longer-term downtrend.

The S&P 500 remains down 12.2% from its February 19 record-high close and down about 8% for the year to date.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 49 new highs and 67 new lows on the NYSE.

""It's a matter of life and death because 60-70 percent of our business is with American clients,"" said Li, marketing manager of Conmo Electronic Co. ""Goods cannot be exported and money cannot be collected. This is very severe.""

This was the first such fair China has held since US President Donald Trump slapped tariffs in excess of 100 percent on China and of at least 10 percent on the rest of the world earlier this month.

Most exporters Reuters spoke with said US orders, which for firms like Li's are vital, have either been delayed or stopped coming - a bad sign for the world's second-largest economy, whose growth last year relied heavily on running a trillion-dollar trade surplus.

And while Trump's tariffs on the rest of the world are much lower, they are likely to curb global demand in coming months - and implicitly, the appetite for Chinese goods in other countries.

Kobe Huang, sales representative at Shenzhen Landun Environmental Technology, which makes water filters and smart toilets, says that for now, European sales are up, but the US market is ""frozen.""

US customers and distributors haven't cancelled orders, he said. ""They have asked us to hold on. We are holding on.""

US importer Levy Spence, president of Air Esscentials, was browsing for the scented products on offer at the fair, but had no particular plan for purchases, because ""every day I wake up, I feel like it's a different tariff.""

""Prices are going to go up,"" he said. ""Even for the stuff that we source in the United States, a lot of the raw materials are sourced from around the world. It's not just the China tariffs.""

Organisers said about 170,000 overseas buyers had registered as of April 8 for this month's fair, compared with a record final attendance of 253,000 at the previous edition, which concluded in November. About 10 percent of those were from the US and Europe, down from roughly 20 percent last time.

The fair takes place April 15-May 5. Deals at the previous edition totalled $25 billion, local media said.

DIVERSIFICATION

Many exporters said they have been either diversifying their production bases outside China, or the markets they sell to, away from the United States.

Henry Han, sales manager at Apexto Electronics Co, which makes SSD and micro SD flash drives, says the US market only accounts for 10 percent of direct sales, down from 30 percent before the pandemic. Many of their customers take shipments of components for final assembly in a third country to avoid the tariffs.

Apexto undertook a study last year to see if it can shift production to Vietnam or the Philippines to avoid direct impact from US tariffs, but Han said these plans were now on ice because these countries may also face high levies.

Trump, on April 2, slapped a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam and 17 percent levy on the Philippines before paring those back to 10 percent for the next three months as he begins bilateral negotiations on trade with about 75 different countries.

Sales manager David Du, from speaker maker Zealot, said an order from Skechers for 30,000 speakers to be distributed to their US stores was put on hold after Trump's tariffs. But he said he can rely on other markets.

Zealot got a big and unexpected break in 2015, when an all-in-one speaker, power bank and emergency flashlight became a hit in Nigeria, now a market twice as big as the US, accounting for 40 percent of total sales and taking in 45 containers monthly.

""We are as big as JBL"" in Nigeria, Du said, referring to the Californian audio equipment brand.

Li, from the medical devices maker, said her firm cannot find new markets overnight. She fears Conmo will soon have to cut working hours, and eventually, staffing levels.

""I worry that if the situation remains deadlocked, and neither side gives in, the ones who will ultimately suffer are the ordinary people,"" said Li.

""How will their salaries be paid? There will be unemployment.""

" Dollar steady as traders grapple with tariff uncertainty, volatility ","
                        
                        
                        The dollar was steady on Tuesday but stayed close to the three-year low against the euro and a six-month trough against the yen it hit last week as investors struggled to make sense of the back-and-forth changes on US tariffs.

 

Still, currency markets were a lot calmer in early Asian hours after last week's turmoil that badly bruised the dollar despite a surge in Treasury yields, highlighting the shaky investor confidence in the greenback and US assets.

 

The dollar was 0.27% higher at 143.53 yen but remained close to the six month low of 142.05 it touched on Friday. The euro EUR=EBS eased 0.22% to $1.1324 just below the three-year high of $1.1474 hit last week.

 

After slumping to a ten-year low against the Swiss franc last week, the dollar CHF=EBS was 0.3% higher in Asian hours. The dollar is down nearly 8% against the Swiss franc this month, set for its biggest monthly drop since December 2008.

 

Market focus has been on the ever-shifting tariff headlines with the US removing smartphones and other electronics from its duties on China over the weekend providing some relief, although comments from President Donald Trump suggested the reprieve is likely to be for a short time.

 

Trump's imposition and then abrupt postponement of tariffs on goods imported to the US has sowed confusion, adding to the uncertainty for investors and policymakers around the world.

 

Kieran Williams, head of Asia FX at InTouch Capital Markets, said the policy confusion and erosion in investor confidence are fuelling a slow but steady rotation out of dollar assets.

 

""The recent backpedaling on US tariffs has eased some of the acute market anxiety, softening the dollar‚Äôs safe-haven appeal in the near term.""

 

The yield on the benchmark US 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR was steady at 4.354% after dropping nearly 13 basis points in the previous session.

 

The yields had risen about 50 basis points last week in the biggest weekly gain in over two decades as analysts and investors questioned the bonds' status as the world‚Äôs safest asset.

 

""Last week was all about deleveraging, liquidation, and asset re-allocation out of US assets. This week's tone is calmer in what is a holiday shortened week,"" said Prashant Newnaha, senior Asia-Pacific rates strategist at TD Securities.

 

""Helping to set the tone were dovish comments from Fed officials suggesting they are looking beyond inflation.""

 

Fed Governor Christopher Waller said on Monday the Trump administration's tariff policies are a major shock to the US economy that could lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to head off a recession even if inflation remains high.

 

Traders are pricing in 86 basis points of cuts from the Fed for the rest of the year, LSEG data showed.

 

The dollar index =USD, which measures the US currency against six other units, was at 99.864, not far from the three year low it touched last week. The index is down over 4% this month, set for its biggest monthly drop since November 2022.

 

Sterling GBP=D3 was steady at $1.31825. The Australian dollar AUD=D3 rose 0.23% at $0.63415, while the New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 was 0.41% higher at $0.58985.

" US steps up probes into pharmaceutical, chip imports, setting stage for tariffs ","
                        
                        
                        The Trump administration is proceeding with probes into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of a bid to impose tariffs on both sectors on grounds that extensive reliance on foreign production of medicine and chips is a national security threat, Federal Register filings on Monday showed.

 

The filings announce 21-day public comment periods and mark President Donald Trump's latest use of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 as justification for so-called sectoral tariffs aimed at boosting domestic production of goods he says are critical to national security.

 

Using the 232 provision, the Trump administration has started investigations into imports of copper and lumber, and probes completed during Trump's first term formed the basis for 25% tariffs rolled out since his return to the White House in January on steel and aluminium and on the auto industry.

 

The filings, which indicate the administration began the investigations on Apr 1, follow exclusions unveiled over the weekend for smartphones, computers and other electronics imported largely from China from Trump's steep 125% reciprocal duties. Trump officials had said those products would soon be subject to Section 232 tariffs.

 

Section 232 probes need to be completed within 270 days of their initiation.

 

Trump has made use of tariffs a central plank of his administration's economic and national security policies, rolling out a series of aggressive levies against trading partners that economists estimate have lifted the average import duty to around 25% from just 2.5% in matter of months.

 

The announcements have roiled financial markets, with most US stock indexes now down 10% or more from record highs hit following Trump's election win in November. Waves of economists have also downgraded their outlooks for the American economy, many foretelling higher joblessness and inflation in the wake of Trump's tariffs.

 

A top Federal Reserve official - Governor Christopher Waller - earlier on Monday called Trump's tariff policy ""one of the biggest shocks to affect the US economy in many decades.""

 

'BREATHING ROOM AND VISIBILITY'

 

The US began collecting baseline tariffs of 10% on most US imports on April 5, and Trump on April 9 put on hold even stiffer levies aimed at goods at dozens of other trading partners, although the heftiest tariffs targeting China remain in place. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are exempt from those duties, but Trump has said they will face separate tariffs.

 

Trump said on Sunday he would be announcing tariffs on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be flexibility with some companies in the sector.

 

The US relies heavily on chips imported from Taiwan, something former President Joe Biden sought to reverse during his term by granting billions of dollars in Chips Act awards to lure chipmakers to expand production in the United States.

 

The notices published on Monday showed the investigations will include both pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients as well as other derivative products.

 

Drugmakers have argued that tariffs could increase the chance of shortages and reduce access for patients. Still, Trump has pushed for the fees, arguing that the US needs more drug manufacturing so it does not have to rely on other countries for its supply of medicines.

 

Companies in the industry have lobbied Trump to phase in tariffs on imported pharmaceutical products in hopes of reducing the sting from the charges and to allow time to shift manufacturing.

 

Large drugmakers have global manufacturing footprints, mainly in the US, Europe and Asia, and moving more production to the US involves a major commitment of resources and could take years.

 

""This notice gives us some breathing room and visibility on when the tariffs might be expected, and we will be certainly looking out for the lobby actions that PHRMA and the industry CEOs will be engaging in over the next three weeks,"" said Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen.

 

""We are bracing for announcement of tariffs around mid-May and see tariffs of 10-25% as being possible, with the industry angling for a slow ramping to these tariffs and potential carve-outs,"" Breen said.

 

Gary Shapiro, CEO and Vice Chair of the Consumer Technology Association, said that Trump's Friday exclusion on smartphones, computers and semiconductors recognized that his tariffs will hurt consumers.

 

""At the same time, the shift from IEEPA to Section 232 as a legal basis for tariffs reveals the Administration‚Äôs desire for a more durable justification,"" Shapiro said in a statement. ""But claiming that downstream consumer tech products qualify as 'semiconductors' is a stretch.""

 

He called for ""a smarter, targeted trade strategy where we team up with allies to compete with China.""

" India's polished diamond exports hit two-decade low, industry group says ","
                        
                        
                        India's exports of cut and polished diamonds plummeted to their lowest level in nearly two decades in the 2024/25 fiscal year, which ended in March, on sluggish demand from the United States and China, a leading trade body said on Monday.

 

India is the world's largest cutting and polishing hub, handling nine out of every 10 diamonds processed globally. But it is sensitive to economic uncertainty - particularly in the US, its biggest market.

 

Cut and polished diamond exports, which usually account for nearly half of overall gem and jewellery shipments, fell 16.8% to $13.3 billion year-on-year, the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) said in a statement.

 

The slump dragged down overall gem and jewellery exports by 11.7% to $28.5 billion - a four-year low - from $32.28 billion the previous year.

 

The lower demand for polished diamonds also prompted Indian processors to reduce imports of rough diamonds by 24.3% to $10.8 billion, the trade body said.

 

Gems and jewellery exports rose by 1% year-on-year in March, however, to $2.56 billion, the GJEPC said, as exporters ramped up shipments ahead of announced US tariffs.

 

US President Donald Trump initially planned to place a 27% tariff on imported Indian goods from April 9 as part of duties targeting dozens of countries, but then declared a 90-day pause on the measure.

 

 

""US buyers were loading up in March before the tariffs kicked in. Indian exporters were also rushing to ship out US orders first, so they wouldn't get hit with those extra costs,"" said Shaunak Parikh, vice-chairman of GJEPC.

 

India's gems and jewellery exports are unlikely to recover this year, one major Mumbai-based exporter told Reuters, as the US tariffs have roiled global markets and shaken buyer confidence.
